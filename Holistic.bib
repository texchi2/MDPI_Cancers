abstract = {BACKGROUND: The significance of mindfulness meditation (MM) has increased in recent years in both clinical settings and public health. However, ways to implement MM as a disease prevention or treatment method in the elderly is still a major challenge. A comprehensive analysis of previous studies on MM programs for the elderly in Korea will help build future integrated care programs that incorporate MM. METHODS: Seven international and Korean domestic electronic databases were searched to collect relevant clinical studies until May 30, 2020. RESULTS: Sixteen articles with twelve clinical studies were included in this review. The MM program was generally offered once a week over eight weeks with a duration of between 60 and 90 min per session. The main reason for participants' drop out was poor program compliance attributed to conflicting schedules, physical illness, or a change of mind. The program results were either positive or mixed, but the mindfulness level of the participants was improved. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes information obtained from previously published studies in Korea, on the design considerations, characteristics, and preliminary effectiveness of the MM program for the elderly. The findings can be used as preliminary data by future practitioners and/or researchers to design MM programs targeted toward the elderly; it could also help policymakers integrate MM-based strategies into integrated care programs to promote their mental health and well-being.},

abstract = {Computational modeling and meditation are not frequently mentioned in the same breath. However, in this article we argue that computational modeling can provide insights into the mechanisms by which meditation produces its effects on cognition. Moreover, computational modeling allows the researcher to make predictions about how effects of meditation will generalize to other contexts such as other tasks, which can be tested in subsequent experiments. In addition, computational theories can help to clarify similarities and differences between meditation practices, which is crucial for mapping out the space of contemplative practices. In short, even though computational modeling has not yet been used extensively, we think this approach can make important contributions to the field of meditation research.},

abstract = {Many of today's most common, chronic, and costly diseases—from high blood pressure, to chronic pain—are related to stress. Mindfulness, considered a state, a trait, and a training, might help treat or prevent stress-related physical symptoms. A concise review of current scientific evidence shows that both higher levels of trait mindfulness as well as mindfulness training are associated with better psychological well-being, coping, and quality of life. Effects on objective measures of disease, however, are often non-significant or await replication. Larger trials with active control groups, clear diagnostic criteria, objective outcome measures, and longer-term follow-up are needed to generate better quality evidence. Yet, many studies do support integrating mindfulness into health care as part of self-care and disease management.},
annote = {Highlights
•
Many of today's most common, costly, and chronic diseases are stress-related.
•
Mindfulness, as both a dispositional trait and as a skill-based training, can reduce patient-reported symptoms of stress in physical disease.
•
There is little good quality evidence that mindfulness-based interventions impact objective biomarkers of disease severity or progression.
•
Adequate empirical support exists to integrate mindfulness with conventional medical care for many stress-related chronic diseases.
•
Studies should clarify if mindfulness impacts objective disease measures, generalizes to diverse populations, and is effective in non-academic health settings.},

abstract = {In the last decade, epigenetics has taken center stage to explain the relationships between stress exposure, health and behavior. Acquired or inherited epigenetic changes modulate gene expression states without modifying the DNA sequence itself, they can be long-lasting, yet, they are potentially reversible. Several studies have explored whether meditation-based interventions can influence gene expression profiles towards healthier directions, identifying candidate genes and biological pathways that seem to be sensitive to contemplative practices. However, to date, the clinical implications of these molecular outcomes and their potential long-lasting epigenetic bases remain mostly unknown. The present article addresses these topics from a broad perspective and analyzes future research questions and perspectives at the crossroads of contemplative sciences and epigenetics.},

@misc{Black2019,
abstract = {Recent research in functional genomics shows that social stressors affect the expression of immune response genes. These effects are mediated in part via our adaptive capacity for intracellular molecules to respond to extracellular signals, a process called signal transduction. Under this framework, one-way stressors can be transduced into cellular changes is through central nervous system (CNS) modulation of peripheral neural, endocrine, and molecular activity. Mindfulness meditation is a consciousness discipline used to cultivate attention and self-regulation, and may thus be relevant to the signal transduction process outlined in the social genomics literature. In this opinion article, we briefly review results from existing controlled trials that test the effects of mindfulness meditation on gene expression. We then speculate on a mind-body conceptual model, grounded in existing social genomics theory. In the spirit of hypothesis generation, we argue that mindfulness meditation changes brain activity patterns related to attention, self-regulation, and threat evaluation and so may alter the signal transduction process that regulates the expression of immune response genes.},

abstract = {Meditating is an active mental process that has been proposed to lead to structural changes in the brain, especially if occurring repeatedly, regularly, and over longer periods of time. Thus, meditators might present with a distinctive brain anatomy detectable via modern imaging technologies. This article summarizes findings as reported in the imaging literature when comparing long-term meditators with controls. The morphometric analyses applied include global, regional, and local measures, such as voxel-wise or point-wise estimates. Overall, long-term meditators present with larger (rather than smaller) anatomical measures than controls, which may be indicative of actual meditation-induced changes, pre-existing differences in meditators' brains, or a combination of both.},

abstract = {A broad range of mind-body therapies (MBTs) are used by the public today, and a growing body of clinical and basic sciences research has resulted in evidence-based integration of many MBTs into clinical practice. Basic sciences research has identified some of the physiological correlates of MBT practices, leading to a better understanding of the processes by which emotional, cognitive and psychosocial factors can influence health outcomes and well-being. In particular, results from functional genomics and neuroimaging describe some of the processes involved in the mind-body connection and how these can influence health outcomes. Functional genomic and neurophysiological correlates of MBTs are reviewed, detailing studies showing changes in sympathetic nervous system activation of gene transcription factors involved in immune function and inflammation, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging studies on MBT practices, and persistent changes in neural function and morphology associated with these practices. While the broad diversity of study designs and MBTs studied presents a patchwork of results requiring further validation through replication and longitudinal studies, clear themes emerge for MBTs as immunomodulatory, with effects on leukocyte transcription and function related to inflammatory and innate immune responses, and neuromodulatory, with effects on brain function and morphology relevant for attention, learning, and emotion regulation. By detailing the potential mechanisms of action by which MBTs may influence health outcomes, the data generated by these studies have contributed significantly towards a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying MBTs.},
