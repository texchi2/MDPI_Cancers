abstract = {Aim: To develop a simple assay for the capture and detection of rare cancer cells in whole blood using iron oxide-gold (IO-Au) nanoparticles. Materials {\&} methods: IO-Au nanoovals (NOVs) were synthesized, coated with Raman tags and linked with antibodies targeting breast cancer. An integrated system was constructed for on-line magnetic cell capture and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. The capabilities of IO-Au SERS NOVs to capture and detect rare cancer cells in blood were investigated in the integrated system using circulating tumor cell-mimic SK-BR-3 cells. Results: SK-BR-3 cells in whole blood were magnetically captured under a flow condition using IO-Au SERS NOVs, followed by on-line SERS detection with a limit of detection of 1-2 cells/ml blood. Conclusion: We developed a sensitive method that can capture and detect cancer cells in whole blood with a single nanoconstruct, which is highly promising for the detection of circulating tumor cells in the clinic.

abstract = {Many biomedical products have already been obtained from marine organisms. In order to search more therapeutic drugs against cancer, this study demonstrates the cytotoxicity effects of Cladiella australis, Clavularia viridis and Klyxum simplex extracts on human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC4, SCC9 and SCC25) cells using cell adhesion and cell viability assay. The morphological alterations in SCCs cells after treatment with three extracts, such as typical nuclear condensation, nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic bodies of cells were demonstrated by Hoechst stain. Flow cytometry indicated that three extracts sensitized SCC25 cells in the G(0)/G(1) and S-G(2)/M phases with a concomitant significantly increased sub-G(1) fraction, indicating cell death by apoptosis. This apoptosis process was accompanied by activation of caspase-3 expression after SCC25 cells were treated with three extracts. Thereby, it is possible that extracts of C. australis, C. viridis and K. simplex cause apoptosis of SCCs and warrant further research investigating the possible anti-oral cancer compounds in these soft corals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is thought to develop from precancerous dysplastic lesions through multistep processes of carcinogenesis involving activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressor genes. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2/neu [erbB-2]), a cell membrane glycoprotein, is a growth factor receptor that has receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Her2/neu activation plays a central role in cell proliferation and survival. It has been shown that overexpression of Her2/neu increases the rate of cell division and growth, leading to precancerous changes. The aim of the present study was to compare the serum and salivary Her2/neu levels between cases with premalignant and malignant oral lesions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fasting blood samples and unstimulated saliva by passive drooling were collected from three groups of healthy control (n=20), premalignant disorder (PMD) (n=20) and OSCC (n=25) subjects. The HER2 extracellular domain (HER2 ECD) levels were measured using ELISA.

RESULTS: The levels of serum Her2/neu showed no significant differences between any of the groups but on the other hand salivary Her2/neu levels were found to be significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher when compared between control (median 68.7 pg/ml, range: 21.5 - 75.8) and OSCC (median 145.6 pg/ml, range: 45.1-191.1). A similar trend was observed when comparing between PMD (median 43.3, range: 22.1 -94.7) and OSCC with a statistical significance of p{\textless}0.05.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided evidence of increased salivary Her2/neu in OSCC when compared to PMD and control which was not the case for serum levels. This suggests that probably Her2/neu is not highly amplified as in breast cancer so as to be reflected in serum. Since saliva is in local vicinity of the OSCC, even a mild increase might be mirrored. On the whole, this study proposes Her2/neu as marker for distinguishing premalignant and malignant conditions.},

abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinomas are among the 10 most common cancers and have a 50{\%} lethality rate after 5 years. Despite easy access to the oral cavity for cancer screening, the main limitations to successful treatment are uncertain prognostic criteria for (pre-)malignant lesions. Identifying a functional cellular marker may represent a significant improvement for diagnosis and treatment. Toward this goal, mechanical phenotyping of individual cells is a novel approach to detect cytoskeletal changes, which are diagnostic for malignant change. The compliance of cells from cell lines and primary samples of healthy donors and cancer patients was measured using a microfluidic optical stretcher. Cancer cells showed significantly different mechanical behavior, with a higher mean deformability and increased variance. Cancer cells (n approximately 30 cells measured from each patient) were on average 3.5 times more compliant than those of healthy donors [D(normal) = (4.43 +/- 0.68) 10(-3) Pa(-1); D(cancer) = (15.8 +/- 1.5) 10(-3) Pa(-1); P {\textless} 0.01]. The diagnosis results of the patient samples were confirmed by standard histopathology. The generality of these findings was supported by measurements of two normal and four cancer oral epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate that mechanical phenotyping is a sensible, label-free approach for classifying cancer cells to enable broad screening of suspicious lesions in the oral cavity. It could in principle be applied to any cancer to aid conventional diagnostic procedures.},

abstract = {TCam-2 cells are the main in vitro model for investigations into seminomatous tumors. However, despite their widespread use, questions remain regarding the cells' homogeneity and consequently how representative they are of seminomas. We assess the TCam-2 cell line using routine and novel authentication methods to determine its homogeneity, identify any cellular sub-populations and resolve whether any changes could be due to generational differentiation. TCam-2, embryonal carcinoma cells (2102EP) and breast cancer cell (MCF7) lines were assessed using qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and short tandem repeat analyses. Raman maps of individual cells (minimum of 10) and single scan spectra from 200 cells per culture were obtained. TCam-2s displayed the characteristic marker gene expression pattern for seminoma, were uniform in size and granularity and short tandem repeat analysis showed no contamination. However, based only on physical parameters, flowcytometry was unable to differentiate between TCam-2 and 2102EPs. Raman maps of TCam-2s comprised three equally distributed, distinct spectral patterns displaying large intercellular single spectral variation. All other cells showed little variation. Principal component, cluster and local spectral angle analyses indicated that the TCam-2s contained two different types of cells, one of which comprised two subgroups and was similar to some 2102EP cells. Protein expression corroborated the presence of different cells and generational differences. The detailed characterization provided by the Raman spectra, augmented by the routine methods, provide substantiation to the long-held suspicion that TCam-2 are not homogeneous but comprise differing cell populations, one of which may be embryonal carcinoma in origin.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to study its possible clinical application in cancer diagnosis. However, in order to make it into clinical practice, it is important that this technique is able not only to identify cancer cells from their normal counterparts, but also from the array of cells present in human tissues. To this purpose, we used Raman spectroscopy to assess whether this technique was able to differentiate not only between lung cancer cells and lung epithelial cells but also from lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, we studied whether the differences were due to cell lineage (epithelial versus fibroblast) or to different proliferative characteristics of cells, and where in the cell compartment these differences might reside. To answer these questions we studied cell cytoplasm, cell nucleus and isolated whole cell nuclei. Our data suggests that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate between lung cancer, lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts. More important, it can also differentiate between 2 cells from the same lineage (fibroblast) but with one of them rendered immortal and with an increased proliferative activity. Finally, it seems that the main spectral differences reside in the cell nucleus and that the study of isolated nuclei strengthens the differences between cells.},

abstract = {Cyr61 is associated with growth and progression of many types of tumors and is an independent poor prognostic indicator for oral cancer patients. Areca nut (AN) chewing is the most important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of oral cancer in India and many Southeast Asian countries. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involved in the AN-induced oral cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that arecoline, a main alkaloid found in AN, stimulated Cyr61 synthesis in human gingival epithelial S-G cells. Constitutive overexpression of Cyr61 protein in oral epithelial cells during AN chewing may play a role in the pathogenesis of oral cancer. ERK inhibitor PD98059, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) selective inhibitor Y-27632 and a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor reduced the arecoline-stimulated levels of Cyr61 protein by ∼31{\%}, 47{\%}, 65{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively. Lovastatin also completely inhibited arecoline-induced Cyr61 synthesis and the inhibition is dose-dependent. Decreased of geranylgeranylated proteins could be the mechanism that lovastatin regulates Cyr61 synthesis and lovastatin could serve as a useful agent in controlling AN-induced oral cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly lethal cancer that contains cellular and functional heterogeneity. Previously, we enriched a subpopulation of highly tumorigenic head and neck cancer initiating cells (HN-CICs) from HNSCC. However, the molecular mechanisms by which to govern the characteristics of HN-CICs remain unclear. GRP78, a stress-inducible endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, has been reported to play a crucial role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, but the role of GRP78 in CICs has not been elucidated.

RESULTS: Initially, we recognized GRP78 as a putative candidate on mediating the stemness and tumorigenic properties of HN-CICs by differential systemic analyses. Subsequently, cells with GRP78 anchored at the plasma membrane (memGRP78+) exerted cancer stemness properties of self-renewal, differentiation and radioresistance. Of note, xenotransplantation assay indicated merely 100 memGRP78+ HNSCCs resulted in tumor growth. Moreover, knockdown of GRP78 significantly reduced the self-renewal ability, side population cells and expression of stemness genes, but inversely promoted cell differentiation and apoptosis in HN-CICs. Targeting GRP78 also lessened tumorigenicity of HN-CICs both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, co-expression of GRP78 and Nanog predicted the worse survival prognosis of HNSCC patients by immunohistochemical analyses. Finally, depletion of GRP78 in HN-CICs induced the expression of Bax, Caspase 3, and PTEN.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, memGRP78 should be a novel surface marker for isolation of HN-CICs, and targeting GRP78 signaling might be a potential therapeutic strategy for HNSCC through eliminating HN-CICs.},

The early detection of cancer is critical for its successful therapy, which can result in complete recovery from some types of cancer.

METHODS: Raman spectroscopy has been widely used in medicine and biology. It is a noninvasive, nondestructive, and water-insensitive technique that can detect changes in cells and tissues that are caused by different disorders, such as cancer. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used for the identification and characterization of murine fibroblast cell lines (NIH/3T3) and malignant fibroblast cells transformed by murine sarcoma virus (NIH-MuSV) cells.

RESULTS: Using principal component analysis and LDA it was possible to differentiate between the NIH/3T3 and NIH-MuSV cells with an 80-85{\%} success rate based on their Raman shift spectra.

CONCLUSIONS: The best results for differentiation were achieved from spectra that were obtained from the rich membrane sites.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Because of its homogeneity and complete control of most factors affecting its growth, cell culture is a preferred model for the detection and identification of specific biomarkers related to cancer transformation or other cellular modifications.},

abstract = {The relatively modest survival of patients surgically treated for advanced HNSCC can partly be explained by the development of local relapse. It is important that surgeons are able to predict which patients are at high risk to develop local relapse, since clinical management can be tailored. Local relapse after resection of a primary HNSCC is easily explained, when tumour is detected in the surgical margins and thus residual tumour is likely to remain in the patient, but the pathobiology is more complex in cases where the margins are histologically tumour-free. Molecular studies indicate that there are two different mechanisms responsible in these cases. First, small clusters of residual tumour cells that are undetectable on routine histopathological examination (known as minimal residual cancer: MRC) proliferate and this forms the basis of recurring cancer. A second cause of relapse is a remaining field of preneoplastic cells that is struck by additional genetic hits leading to invasive cancer. It is likely that within this field, that can be over 7cm in diameter, the primary carcinoma has also emerged. Despite careful histopathological examination of the surgical margins of the primary carcinoma, it is at present not reliably possible to predict which patient will develop local relapse. Herein we focus on new developments regarding the analysis of margins, causes of local relapse, and how novel molecular techniques can be of help in a more accurate risk assessment. Critical analysis of the studies that have been published thus far shows that there is a list of promising markers, based on protein expression (immuno-histochemistry) and nucleic acid analysis. Further studies should be focused on validation and assessment of the clinical utility of these markers. Margin analysis should reveal whether one is dealing with residual cancer cells that might be treated by post-operative radiotherapy or with preneoplastic fields that remained behind. For this latter entity, there is no intervention available at present, except for a more intensive surveillance.},

In this study we demonstrate a systematic approach for optimizing the various parameters of WMRS to achieve a reduction in the acquisition time for potential applications such as higher throughput cell screening. The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the Raman bands depends on the modulation amplitude, time constant and total acquisition time. It was observed that the sampling rate does not influence the signal to noise ratio of the Raman bands if three or more wavelengths are sampled. With these optimised WMRS parameters, we increased the throughput in the binary classification of normal human urothelial cells and bladder cancer cells by reducing the total acquisition time to 6 s which is significantly lower in comparison to previous acquisition times required for the discrimination between similar cell types.},

Folic acid (FA) molecules were attached to the RGO-AgNP by physisorption for targeting specific cancer cells with folate receptors (FRs) and using as Raman reporter molecules. The internalization of the FA loaded RGO-AgNP (RGO-AgNP-FA) inside the FRs-positive cancer cell was confirmed by confocal laser scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The Raman signals of the FA in live cancer cells were detected by confocal Raman spectroscope at 514 nm excitation, indicating that the RGO-AgNP-FA material has great potential as a Raman probe for cancer diagnosis in vitro.},

Irreversible damage to cell proliferation was noted in S-G cells exposed to 75-150 microM resveratrol for 2 days and then subsequently maintained for another 3 days in resveratrol-free medium. The cytotoxicity of resveratrol was neither potentiated nor ameliorated in the presence of an hepatic S9 microsomal fraction. The cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide to S-G cells was lessened by N-acetyl-L-cysteine and quercetin, but not by resveratrol. For nitric oxide, only N-acetyl-L-cysteine reduced toxicity. The ability of resveratrol to function as an antioxidant was, therefore, not noted under these test conditions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To gain new insights into the relationship between angiogenic factors in breast cancer and their effect on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and metastasis, we characterized and validated the "metastatic signature" of human breast cancer cell lines engineered to overexpress VEGF in terms of in vivo MRI-derived angiogenesis and ECM transport parameters.

METHODOLOGY: MRI was used to evaluate the effects of overexpressing VEGF-A (VEGF165) on tumor angiogenesis and ECM remodeling in vivo, for two differentially metastatic human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overexpression of VEGF elevated vascular volume in both MCF-7-VEGF and MDA-MB-231-VEGF tumors relative to their wild-type counterparts, but vascular permeability was elevated only in MCF-7-VEGF tumors. A significant increase in the volume of extravascular fluid drained as well as the number of ECM drainage voxels was detected in MCF-7-VEGF tumors relative to MCF-7 tumors, but not in MDA-MB-231-VEGF versus MDA-MB-231 tumors. The angiogenic effects of VEGF overexpression in both MCF-7-VEGF and MDA-MB-231-VEGF tumors were validated histologically. MCF-7-VEGF tumors exhibited enhanced invasion and a greater fraction of cancer positive lungs and lymph nodes relative to MCF-7 tumors.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In vivo MRI and histological data demonstrate that VEGF overexpression results in the progression of noninvasive MCF-7 and invasive MDA-MB-321 tumors to a more angiogenic phenotype. However, VEGF overexpression significantly altered ECM integrity only in MCF-7 tumors, causing them to progress to an invasive and metastatic phenotype. This study for the first time demonstrates the concurrent effects of VEGF overexpression and ECM remodeling on metastasis in vivo. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vivo MRI can non-invasively monitor changes in the tumor microenvironment that can potentially predict a cancer's ability to metastasize.},

In this study we investigated Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots (3C-SiC QDs) cellular localisation and influence on viability and proliferation on oral squamous carcinoma (AT-84 and HSC) and immortalized cell lines (S-G). They clearly localize into the nuclei, but the presence of 3C-SiC QDs in culture medium provoke morphological changes in cultured cells. We demonstrate that 3C-SiC QDs display dose- and time-dependent selective cytotoxicity on cancer versus immortalized cells in vitro.

abstract = {We present the application of a theranostic system combining Raman imaging and the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. The theranostic nanoplatform was created by loading the photosensitizer, protoporphyrin IX, onto a Raman-labeled gold nanostar. A cell-penetrating peptide, TAT, enhanced intracellular accumulation of the nanoparticles in order to improve their delivery and efficacy. The plasmonic gold nanostar platform was designed to increase the Raman signal via the surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) effect. Theranostic SERS imaging and photodynamic therapy using this construct were demonstrated on BT-549 breast cancer cells. The TAT peptide allowed for effective Raman imaging and photosensitization with the nanoparticle construct after a 1 h incubation period. In the absence of the TAT peptide, nanoparticle accumulation in the cells was not sufficient to be observed by Raman imaging or to produce any photosensitization effect after this short incubation period. There was no cytotoxic effect observed after nanoparticle incubation, prior to light activation of the photosensitizer. This report shows the first application of combined SERS imaging and photosensitization from a theranostic nanoparticle construct.},

abstract = {The nucleolus is a prominent subnuclear structure whose major function is the transcription and assembly of ribosome subunits. The size of the nucleolus varies with the cell cycle, proliferation rate and stress. Changes in nucleolar size, number, chemical composition, and shape can be used to characterize malignant cells. We used spontaneous Raman microscopy as a label-free technique to examine nucleolar spatial and chemical features. Raman images of the 1003 cm(-1) phenylalanine band revealed large, well-defined subnuclear protein structures in MFC-7 breast cancer cells. The 783 cm(-1) images showed that nucleic acids were similarly distributed, but varied more in intensity, forming observable high-intensity regions. High subnuclear RNA concentrations were observed within some of these regions as shown by 809 cm(-1) Raman band images. Principal component analyses of sub-images and library spectra validated the subnuclear presence of RNA. They also revealed that an actin-like protein covaried with DNA within the nucleolus, a combination that accounted for 64{\%} or more of the spectral variance. Embryonic stem cells are another rapidly proliferating cell type, but their nucleoli were not as large or well defined. Estimating the size of the larger MCF-7 nucleolus was used to show the utility of Raman microscopy for morphometric analyses. It was concluded that imaging based on Raman microscopy provides a promising new method for the study of nucleolar function and organization, in the evaluation of drug and experimental effects on the nucleolus, and in clinical diagnostics and prognostics.},

The approach of combining the unique physical properties of noble-metal nanoparticles with their chemical specificity and an easy way of conjugation open up new routes toward building bio-nano-objects for biomedical tracking and imaging. This work reports the design and assessment of a novel class of biocompatible, highly sensitive SERS nanotags based on chitosan-coated silver nanotriangles (Chit-AgNTs) labeled with para-aminothiophenol (p-ATP). The triangular nanoparticles are used as Raman scattering enhancers and have proved to yield a reproducible and strong SERS signal. When tested inside lung cancer cells (A549) this class of SERS nanotags presents low in vitro toxicity, without interfering with cell proliferation. Easily internalized by the cells, as demonstrated by imaging using both reflected bright-light optical microscopy and SERS spectroscopy, the particles are proved to be detectable inside cells under a wide window of excitation wavelengths, ranging from visible to near infrared (NIR). Their high sensitivity and NIR availability make this class of SERS nanotags a promising candidate for noninvasive imaging of cancer cells.},

We analyzed published breast cancer microarray databases to predict five-year recurrence and compared the performance of three data mining algorithms of artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees (DT) and logistic regression (LR) and two composite models of DT-ANN and DT-LR. The collection of microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, four breast cancer datasets were pooled for predicting five-year breast cancer relapse. After data compilation, 757 subjects, 5 clinical variables and 13,452 genetic variables were aggregated. The bootstrap method, Mann--Whitney U test and 20-fold cross-validation were performed to investigate candidate genes with 100 most-significant p-values. The predictive powers of DT, LR and ANN models were assessed using accuracy and the area under ROC curve. The associated genes were evaluated using Cox regression. RESULTS: The DT models exhibited the lowest predictive power and the poorest extrapolation when applied to the test samples. The ANN models displayed the best predictive power and showed the best extrapolation. The 21 most-associated genes, as determined by integration of each model, were analyzed using Cox regression with a 3.53-fold (95{\%} CI: 2.24-5.58) increased risk of breast cancer five-year recurrence... CONCLUSIONS: The 21 selected genes can predict breast cancer recurrence. Among these genes, CCNB1, PLK1 and TOP2A are in the cell cycle G2/M DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Oncologists can offer the genetic information for patients when understanding the gene expression profiles on breast cancer recurrence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper describes an environmentally friendly ("green") approach for the synthesis of soluble graphene using Bacillus marisflavi biomass as a reducing and stabilizing agent under mild conditions in aqueous solution. In addition, the study reported here investigated the cytotoxicity effects of graphene oxide (GO) and bacterially reduced graphene oxide (B-rGO) on the inhibition of cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and membrane integrity in human breast cancer cells.

METHODS: The reduction of GO was characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Size distribution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering. Further, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the crystallinity of graphene and the morphologies of prepared graphene, respectively. The formation of defects further supports the bio-functionalization of graphene, as indicated in the Raman spectrum of B-rGO. Surface morphology and the thickness of the GO and B-rGO were analyzed using atomic force microscopy, while the biocompatibility of GO and B-rGO were investigated using WST-8 assays on MCF-7 cells. Finally, cellular toxicity was evaluated by ROS generation and membrane integrity assays.

RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and simple method for the preparation of water-soluble graphene using bacterial biomass. This reduction method avoids the use of toxic reagents such as hydrazine and hydrazine hydrate. The synthesized soluble graphene was confirmed using various analytical techniques. Our results suggest that both GO and B-rGO exhibit toxicity to MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a dose {\textgreater} 60 $\mu$g/mL exhibiting obvious cytotoxicity effects, such as decreasing cell viability, increasing ROS generation, and releasing of lactate dehydrogenase.

CONCLUSION: We developed a green and a simple approach to produce graphene using bacterial biomass as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The proposed approach confers B-rGO with great potential for various biological and biomedical applications.},

Despite this careful stratification, the survival rate for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains {\textless}30{\%}, and it is not possible to predict which of these high-risk patients will survive or succumb to the disease. Therefore, we have performed gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays containing 42,578 clones and used artificial neural networks to develop an accurate predictor of survival for each individual patient with neuroblastoma. Using principal component analysis we found that neuroblastoma tumors exhibited inherent prognostic specific gene expression profiles. Subsequent artificial neural network-based prognosis prediction using expression levels of all 37,920 good-quality clones achieved 88{\%} accuracy. Moreover, using an artificial neural network-based gene minimization strategy in a separate analysis we identified 19 genes, including 2 prognostic markers reported previously, MYCN and CD44, which correctly predicted outcome for 98{\%} of these patients. In addition, these 19 predictor genes were able to additionally partition Children's Oncology Group-stratified high-risk patients into two subgroups according to their survival status (P = 0.0005). Our findings provide evidence of a gene expression signature that can predict prognosis independent of currently known risk factors and could assist physicians in the individual management of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.},
