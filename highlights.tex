Comments from the reviewer #1:

Comments and Suggestions for Authors
The authors have described the effectiveness of RNA sequencing as a tool for exploring prognostic factors; they have also performed a large-scale analysis using the TCGA cohort, which is a very attractive analysis method. I have a few minor questions.
This is an attractive analysis method and I would like to know more details.

1-1) it is generally known that high expression of EGFR is a poor prognostic factor in head and neck cancers, however, why is it that RNA sequencing does not identify RNA coding for EGFR as a poor prognostic factor?

1-2)
 DNA alteration (mutation/amplification) is also an influential prognostic factor, but I would like to know if DNA alteration is considered in this analysis.
[如果加入 DNA alteration 又會如何? 選擇 mRNA 的原因是?]

Answer
a). mRNA study: in drug discovery, the gene expression (overexpression) is much easier to find a candidate for an inhibitory lead (pro-drug?) 比較容易研發

b). => it needs deep learning (DNA+RNA omics study)

The presence of widespread genomic instability in HNSCC, such as cytogenetic aberrations, allelic imbalance/loss of heterozygosity, and microsatellite instability, suggests that there is an imperfection in the host DNA repair machinery. Genomic instability with progressive accumulation of detrimental genetic alterations appears to be dependent upon a circuitous interaction between the environmental genotoxic insults and the host DNA repair machinery, the functional integrity of which is governed by the proper cell cycle control and host DNA repair capacity.

TMB: To calculate TMB, you need to know the total size of the region sequenced. If data is from exome sequencing, you would find the size of the exome capture, and divide total mutations (or non-synonymous only depending on strategy), by that size (e.g. ~45MB) to get SNV/MB ratio.

雖然以上我們討論的是癌症的基因體，但癌症的厲害就是它本來就利用人體原有的生物機制來生存（co-opting），因此，以上在癌症觀察到的基因體複雜性，其實也存在於正常人體.

從最早，很單純的基因之exon序列，轉錄成mRNA，再轉譯成polypeptide，形成protein，到現在還要考慮epigenetics、mi RNA、TUF (ENCODE將之名為transcripts of unknown function (TUF)=> non-coding RNA 後來很紅)、chromosome environment，基因體的複雜性真是增加了不知多少倍，這也提醒我們在了解基因功能方面，必需更有全面性的關照。這也是「基因體醫學」必需以「基因體科學」為基礎的道理。

DNA mutation, copy number 增加
造成 overexpression of gene

Answer:
所以 DNA vs mRNA 分析不是獨立變數，彼此有 confunding
放入分析需要使用不同的方法 omics analysis

It may be beneficial to include these different data types in models predicting outcomes, such as the survival time of patients. Until recently, only data from a single omics type were used to build such prediction models, with or without the inclusion of standard clinical data [2]. In recent years, however, the increasing availability of different types of omics data measured for the same patients (called multi-omics data from now on) has led to their combined use for building outcome prediction models. An important characteristic of multi-omics data is the high-dimensionality of the datasets, which frequently have more than 10 000 or even 100 000 variables. This places particular demands on the methods used to build prediction models: they must be able to handle data where the number of variables by far exceeds the number of observations. Moreover, practitioners often prefer sparse and interpretable models containing only a few variables [3]. Last but not the least, multi-omics data are structured: the variables are partitioned into (nonoverlapping) groups. This structure may be taken into account when building prediction models.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The R script program could automatically scan protein-coding genes and generate the Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox's univariate/multivariate tables.
    \item Using a serial cut from 30\% to 70\% percentile of the cohort, it could find the least P-value cutoff of the Kaplan-Meier analysis for each gene expression.
    \item Our analysis could discover the pronounced biomarkers, which impact HNSCC's survival under the stringent Bonferroni adjustment.
