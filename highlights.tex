%***Response to reviewer's comments: [藍色字]
\subsection{1-1}
Comments from the reviewer #1:

Comments and Suggestions for Authors
The authors have described the effectiveness of RNA sequencing as a tool for exploring prognostic factors; they have also performed a large-scale analysis using the TCGA cohort, which is a very attractive analysis method. I have a few minor questions.
This is an attractive analysis method and I would like to know more details.

1-1) it is generally known that high expression of EGFR is a poor prognostic factor in head and neck cancers, however, why is it that RNA sequencing does not identify RNA coding for EGFR as a poor prognostic factor?
[我的 candidate 中為什麼沒有 EGFR]

\subsection{1-2}
1-2)
 DNA alteration (mutation/amplification) is also an influential prognostic factor, but I would like to know if DNA alteration is considered in this analysis.
[如果加入 DNA alteration 又會如何? 選擇 mRNA 的原因是?]

Answer
a). mRNA study: in drug discovery, the gene expression (overexpression) is much easier to find a candidate for an inhibitory lead (pro-drug?) 比較容易研發

b). => it needs deep learning (DNA+RNA omics study)

\subsection{2-3}
2-3) Could the authors summarize the elements of the workflow that could be used on any database independently from TCGA?
Answer
Currently, less HNSCC dataset is available worldwide (Indian?) => GEO
generalized use is fine for this workflow, it needs to modify the R code to adapt 
能否套用在別的 database，可以，但需要 d/l raw microarray or RNA-seq 而且需要標準化(fpkm or  It made the messenger \acrshort{rnaseq} matrix with log2 transformed for the downstream analysis, as described in their reference\cite{RSEM2016}.?)
Moreover, we are planning to expand this workflow for pan-cancer studies (other cancer types in the TCGA database).

\subsection{3-1}
reviewer #3

Must be improved:
Is the research design appropriate?
Are the results clearly presented?
Are the conclusions supported by the results?

3-1) Only computer computing in this research to support 20 candidate biomarkers, DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, DKC1, as well as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB, are all heavily associated with the prognosis of OS.
  There is little information provided. The authors should provide more evidence to support this article.

[Answer]
a) Embase searching; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/?view=docsum&query=CAMK2N1%20head%20and%20neck%20cancer
\cite{Wei2019}
through the PubMed searching, the remark on table 1 and table 2 presents the cancer research articles related to our candidate genes.

\section{Highlights}
Highlights
\begin{itemize}
    \item The R script program could automatically scan protein-coding genes and generate the Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox's univariate/multivariate tables.
    \item Using a serial cut from 30\% to 70\% percentile of the cohort, it could find the least P-value cutoff of the Kaplan-Meier analysis for each gene expression.
    \item Our analysis could discover the pronounced biomarkers, which impact HNSCC's survival under the stringent Bonferroni adjustment.
\end{itemize}
