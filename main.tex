% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{The survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It is necessary to determine a cutoff point by the patients' dichotomization for the continuous gene expression in survival analysis. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, the software's predetermined cutoffs are usually set at the median or quantiles of RNA sequencing value to perform the survival analyses. There are few clinicopathological features available on their pre-processed data sets.
We developed a comprehensive workflow that includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker discovery.
Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes. After adjustment with confounders and Bonferroni adjusted P-value, ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of overall survival. At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients, named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB.
We suggest this workflow could help for biomarker discovery.}

\section{Introduction}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (\acrshort{hnscc}), including oral, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal origin, is the fourth leading cancer causes of death for males in Taiwan\cite{MOHW_death2017}. The age-standardized incidence rate of \acrshort{hnscc} in males is 42.43 per 100,000 persons\cite{MOHW_incidence2018}. 
% chemotherapy => systemic therapy
The treatment strategies of \acrshort{hnscc} are surgery alone, systemic therapy with concurrent radiation therapy (systemic therapy/\acrshort{rt}), or surgery with adjuvant systemic therapy/\acrshort{rt} (according to \acrlong{nccn}, \acrshort{nccn} Clinical Practice Guidelines in \acrshort{hnscc}, Version 2.2020)\cite{Pfister2020a}. Despite the improvement in those interventions, the survival of \acrshort{hnscc} has improved only marginally over the past decade worldwide\cite{hpa2019}. The critical advancement of targeted therapy and immuno-oncology should benefit from emerging prognostic biomarkers, which guide the development of modern systemic therapy.

%% TP53 gene => p53 protein; mutation of TP53
Accumulative knowledge showed that some biomarkers have prognostic significance in \acrshort{hnscc}. For example, node-negative \acrshort{hnscc} patients with p53 overexpression were found to have lower survival\cite{DeVicente2004}.
Overexpression of \acrfull{hif}-1 alpha\cite{Aebersold2001} or Ki-67\cite{Couture2002} was found to be correlated with poor response to radiotherapy of \acrshort{hnscc}. The \acrfull{egfr}\cite{O-Charoenrat2000}\cite{Bentzen2005} and \acrfull{mmp}\cite{Harrington2017} were found to be over-expressed to promote invasion and metastasis of \acrshort{hnscc}.
From 2000 to 2006, the anti-\acrshort{egfr} antibody-drug (cetuximab) has been developed and combined with radiotherapy, known as bio-\acrshort{rt}, to increase survival of unresectable locoregionally advanced disease\cite{Bonner2006a}.
The systemic therapy of cetuximab plus platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy (EXTREME regimen) improves overall survival when given as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Vermorken2008}\cite{Rivera2009}. It was approved by the \acrshort{us} \acrfull{fda} in 2008. In advance, the bio-\acrshort{rt} could have proceeded with \acrfull{tpf} induction chemotherapy to overcome the radio-resistance of \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Blanchard2013}.

However, Rampias and his colleagues suggested \acrfull{hras} mutations could mediate cetuximab resistance in systemic therapy of \acrshort{hnscc} via the \acrshort{egfr}/\acrfull{ras}/\acrfull{erk} signaling pathway\cite{Rampias2014}.
After that, the \acrshort{egfr} \acrfull{tki} was introduced to help cetuximab in 2018. The anti-tumor activity was observed in a phase 1 trial for \acrshort{hnscc} patients using cetuximab and afatinib, a \acrshort{tki} of \acrshort{egfr}, \acrfull{her}2, and \acrshort{her}4\cite{Gazzah2018}. Other \acrshort{egfr} \acrshort{tki}, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, osimertinib, were also developed to treat advanced \acrshort{hnscc}.
Although 90\% of \acrshort{hnscc} has overexpression of \acrshort{egfr}, cetuximab has only 10\% to 20\% response rate on those patients. So far, cetuximab is still the only drug of choice with proven efficacy, which targeted the selected \acrshort{hnscc} patients\cite{Taberna2019}.

Until the immuno-oncology era, \acrfull{ici} was introduced since 2014 for treating \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Seiwert2014}\cite{Swanson2015}.
The \acrshort{ici} works on immune checkpoint molecules, which including \acrfull{pd1}, \acrfull{ctla4}, \acrfull{tim3}, \acrfull{lag3}, \acrfull{tigit}, \acrfull{gitr} and \acrfull{vista}\cite{Mei2020}.
The \acrshort{us} \acrshort{fda} has approved the anti-\acrshort{pd1} agents, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab, as a monotherapy for the platinum-treated patients of recurrent or metastatic \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Cramer2019}. However, because of the complexity of immune-tumor interaction, \acrshort{ici} has not to guarantee the response to \acrfull{pdl1} expressed \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Swanson2015}.
According to the phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 study, \acrshort{pdl1} is a validated biomarker used in clinical guidance for candidate selection of pembrolizumab\cite{Burtness2019}\cite{Gavrielatou2020}.

In our previous proteomic study in 2017, \acrfull{tmsb4x} was reported to be related to tumor growth and metastasis of \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Chi2017}. It was also found by the subsequent investigations that \acrshort{tmsb4x} engaged in tumor aggressiveness through \acrfull{emt} on pancreatic\cite{Zhang2008}, gastric\cite{Ryu2012}, colorectal\cite{Gemoll2015}, lung\cite{Huang2016}, ovarian\cite{Chu2019} and melanoma\cite{Makowiecka2019} cancers. Thus, it might be suggested that \acrshort{tmsb4x}  is possible for tumor type-agnostic therapy\cite{Yan2018} as a common biomarker crossing several types of cancer.
%TMSB4X proteins regulate intracellular signal transduction and has been proved to overexpress in various cancers, including colorectal, lung, gastric, pancreatic, and squamous cell cancers.\cite{Chi2017}

%%%%%% revision1 added [TCGA] [2021/02/02]
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project\cite{Weinstein2013} is developed and supervised by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), funded by the US government since 2005.
TCGA represents comprehensive genomics and clinic data from 84,392 patients among 33 major cancer types (data release 27.0 - Oct 29, 2020, available at https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers).
%The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): The TCGA consortium, which is a National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative, makes publicly available molecular and clinical information for more than 33 types of human cancers including exome (variant analysis), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), DNA methylation, transcriptome (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and proteome.
TCGA and other collaborated \acrfull{gdac} generated and analyzed DNA (mutation, copy number variation, methylation, simple nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), RNA (microarray, RNA-Seq, microRNA), and protein (reverse protein phased array) data derived from biospecimen. Sample types available at TCGA are primary solid tumors, recurrent solid tumors, blood-derived normal and tumor, metastatic, and solid tissue normal.  

The NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC, available at https://portal.\\gdc.cancer.gov/) receives, processes, and distributes genomic, clinical, and biospecimen data from TCGA database and other cancer research programs. The clinical features has been defined by \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{gdc} data dictionary: \acrfull{cde}\cite{CDE2019}. The \acrshort{rnaseq} expression data has been harmonized and re-aligned against an official reference genome build (\acrlong{grch38}, \acrshort{grch38}).
%The old TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/tcga/) stops updating and all TCGA data was transferred to the GDC data portal .
\acrshort{tcga}, GDC and research community offer several computational tools to the public for facilitating cancer research. %There is three categories of tools to approach the TCGA data from GDC.
GDC Data Portal (available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) is the official web-based TCGA data analysis tools. Other available web-based tools have been reviewed by Zhang et al.\cite{Zhang2019b} and

One of \acrshort{gdac}s, the Broad TCGA Data and Analyses (Broad GDAC), provides Firehose, a repository of the TCGA public-accessible Level 3 data and Level 4 analyses. Broad GDAC Firehose is an analytical infrastructure that analyses algorithms not performed by the GDC (e.x. GISTIC, MutSig2CV, correlation with clinical variables, mRNA clustering). 
A web-based version of Broad GDAC Firehose is Firebrowse (available at firebrowse.org, Version: 1.1.40, 2019-10-13).

GDC \acrfull{api} is designed under the \acrfull{rest} architecture and provides accessibility to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality found through GDC Portals. Those functions include searching, viewing, submitting, and downloading subsets of data files, metadata, and annotations based on specific parameters. Moreover, if restricted data is requested, the user must provide a token along with the API call. This token can be downloaded directly from the GDC Portals.

\begin{outline}
\1  To the best of our knowledge, the TCGA database is the largest collection (cancer types and cohort size) of comprehensive genomics with survival data available in the field of cancer research so far. The whole-genome sequencing data has been harmonized across all GDACs. The basic demographic data is usually available on many databases. However, TCGA data has more comprehensive features, such as exposure to alcohol, asbestos, radioactive radon, tobacco smoking, or cigarettes.
\1  TCGA has a remarkable advantage for computational and life scientists who study cancer since useful web-tools and API are ready to analyze and visualize TCGA data. It might be getting help quickly from the research community for trouble-shooting.
\1  Many achievements of diagnoses, treatments, and prevention with the TCGA data have already been published and keep growing.\cite{Tomczak2015}

In summary, identifying predictive biomarkers for selecting standard-of-care or advanced systemic therapy\cite{Cristina2019} in \acrshort{hnscc} is crucial. 
However, there are three challenges of biomarker discovery from survival analysis, so far.
Firstly, although \acrshort{tcga} genomics data were harmonized, there is unclean data, including null expressed genes, which over 50\% of the cohort, should be manually investigated and cleaned.
Second, we need to find a way to determine candidates from the expression level of 20,500 human protein-coding genes\cite{Clamp2007}. Usually, the investigators should get the rationale or revelation of the genes of interest on a specific cancer type. They should upload those genes manually onto bioinformatics tools, such as SurvExpress (http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx:8080/Biomatec/ \newline
SurvivaX.jsp\cite{Aguirre-Gamboa2013}, which has been lost since Oct/2019 and currently out of funds), analyze with \acrshort{tcga} cohort. After downloading the survival results, they could curate plots and tables carefully.
It is not possible to scan the whole human protein-coding genome in this way.
Third, we need to find an optimal cutpoint of those \acrshort{rna} expression data to maximize candidate mining coverage. The above mentioned online tools might set a cutpoint at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile for subsequent analyses. There are several visualization software or R packages which deal with cutoff determination, such as Prognoscan\cite{Mizuno2009a}, Cutoff Finder\cite{Budczies2012}, Findcut\cite{Chang2017a}, Human protein atlas\cite{Uhlen2017}, OptimalCutpoints\cite{Cristina2019},  cutpointr (available at https://github.com/thie1e/ \newline
cutpointr), and cutoffR (available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/cutoffR). However, non of them could combine the scanning of the protein-coding genes and cutoff optimization programmatically.

In our approach, this article described a comprehensive workflow implemented in the R script, which runs on the Rstudio server. Its functions include data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker selection.
Using this workflow on the \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort, the 20,500 human protein-coding genes were scanned. The analysis workflow is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}.
%We found that the surgical margin status and tobacco exposure are independent risk factors of patient survival. 
%Our findings also suggested several candidate biomarkers are associated with the prognosis of overall survival (OS) under optimal cutoff point with significant P-value. Those genes may be potential therapeutic targets of HNSCC.

%Step 3 (purple line: dealing with surgical margin).
{The "main procedure" includes data retrieving from TCGA GDC data portal, data process with merging and cleaning, then performing the survival analyses. The Cutoff engine (cutofFinder\_func.HNSCC.R) might calculate all possible Kaplan-Meier P-value to find the optimal cutoff value of RNA-Seq for subsequent Cox modeling (a draft diagram shown on the upper right corner "HNSCC cohort", the serial cut for grouping patients with low [green] or high [red] expression of a specific gene, to yield a collection of P-values; please see Materials and Methods section for details). The step 2 "analysis export" performs dissecting and selection of candidate genes by Bonferroni adjusted P-value as well as a hazard ratio of Cox model, which was based on the results from the step 1.

\section{Results}


The 9416 Kaplan-Meier plots with associated Cox's univariate and multivariate tables were generated at workflow step 1 (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}) and justified by the ranking of hazard ratios.
By uncorrected P-value below 0.05, we selected 967 genes in which \acrfull{hr} is greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5 (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(a) univariate, and Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(b)  multivariate plots). At the final step, a Bonferroni P-value correction was used to yield the twenty candidate genes, under the stringent criteria (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(c), (d)). The ten candidates, including DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, have significantly associated with the poor prognosis of \acrshort{os} (see Table \ref{table:table1}),
%\subsubsection{Figure 3}
while the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients, named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB (see Table \ref{table:table3}, with their full name of genes).
We made a volcano plot for 9416 genes by Kaplan-Meier P-value (less than 0.05, obtained during cutoff finding procedure) against the Cox hazard ratio (see Figure \ref{fig:figure3}). The plot revealed that the most significant (Bonferroni-adjusted P-value $< 0.05$) candidate genes are located above the dotted line. At the same time, Cox's HR separated them on the two-side with prognostic impact.

Our top 1 candidate is \acrfull{DKK1} (see Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(a)). The Kaplan-Meier curve revealed 227 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{DKK1} were suffered from only 40\% of 5-year \acrshort{os} rate. In comparison, the other 187 patients with lower expression (the cutoff at -0.312(RSEM)) have been a better prognosis (adjusted P-value as $0.001$).
Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(b)'s cumulative P-value plot showed that the uncorrected 116 P-values ($< 0.05$) were estimated by a serial cut from 125 to 290 persons for grouping the cohort in our cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R, see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, "HNSCC cohort"). The smallest P-value (\num{8.9e-8}), when cut on n=187 (45.2\% of 414), was defined as optimal P-value.
Conversely, the most associated gene with better survival is \acrfull{ZNF557}. In Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(c), a Kaplan-Meier curve revealed 264 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{ZNF557} have 55\% of 5-year OS survival rate (adjusted P-value = $0.001$). The cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R) generated cumulative P-value plots in Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(d). There were 166 uncorrected P-values estimated by a serial cut from 125 to 290 for grouping the cohort. All was less than 0.05, and the smallest P-value (\num{8.6e-8}), when cut on n=150 (36.2\% of total cohort 414), was defined as optimal P-value with a cutoff value -0.511(RSEM) of \acrshort{rnaseq}.
%The second candidate, which improving patient survival, is ZNF266.

Table \ref{table:table1} showed ten candidate genes over-expressed with poor prognosis in \acrshort{hnscc}, ranked by adjusted Kaplan-Meier P-value. We found their Cox's univariate and multivariate HR are all greater than 1.837. There were few published articles of \acrfull{SURF4} and \acrfull{NDFIP1} (\acrshort{NEDD4}: \acrlong{NEDD4}), which were related to cancer research.
In Table \ref{table:table2},
after adjustment of confounders, it was considered the \acrshort{DKK1} over-expression is the independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR 2.135 [95\% CI: 1.559-2.924, P-value $<$ 0.001]), as well as clinical T stage (HR 1.978 [95\% CI: 1.046-3.737, P-value = 0.036]) and surgical margins status (HR 1.601 [95\% CI: 1.159-2.211, P-value = 0.004]). The age older than 65 year-old has negative influence on survival (HR 1.462 [95\% CI: 1.078-1.983, P-value = 0.015]). The M stage could not be considered due to only 3 out of 414 patients which have distant metastasis.

There were also ten candidate genes over-expressed with a better prognosis of \acrshort{hnscc}, listed in Table \ref{table:table3}. Cox's univariate and multivariate HR is just under 0.5.
In Table \ref{table:table4},
after adjustment of confounders, it revealed HR 1.961 [95\% CI: 1.035-3.714, P-value = 0.039] in advance clinical T Status, HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.18-2.254, P-value = 0.003] with positive surgical margin involvement, HR 1.453 [95\% CI: 1.055-2.000, P-value = 0.022] with higher tobacco exposure, and a protective HR 0.499 [95\% CI: 0.372-0.669, P-value $<$ 0.001] in over-expressed \acrshort{ZNF557} gene.

In overall results, those 20 candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc}.

\section{Discussion}


% TCGAbiolinks
%alcohol consumption
Besides ethnicity, age, gender, the \acrshort{tnm} stage, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the comprehensive adverse features of prognosis in \acrshort{hnscc} should include tobacco exposure, \acrshort{egfr} amplification, \acrfull{hpv} status, positive/close surgical margin ($<5 mm$), \acrfull{ene}, \acrfull{lvsi}, \acrfull{pni}, \acrfull{doi} ($>5 mm$), as well as metastatic \acrfull{lnd}\cite{Cheraghlou2018}, and \acrfull{wpoi5}, which was defined as tumor dispersion $>= 1 mm$ between tumor satellites or positive \acrshort{pni}/\acrshort{lvsi}\cite{Amin2017}.
The features of \acrshort{doi}, \acrshort{lnd}, and tumor dispersion were not available on the \acrshort{tcga} dataset. The Brandwein-Gensler's risk model (lymphocytic host response, \acrshort{wpoi5}, and \acrshort{pni})\cite{Brandwein-Gensler2010}\cite{Sinha2018} was suggested to be routinely performed on pathological examination. In previous reports of \acrshort{hnscc}, the loco-regional failure will be high when the initial frozen section has a positive/close surgical margin, and even the final margin revision revealed negative\cite{Bulbul2019b}.
According to Table \ref{table:table2} and Table \ref{table:table4} in our study, the positive surgical margin yielded a hazard ratio greater than 1.6 to influence on patient's \acrshort{os}.
It was suggested by authors \cite{Scholl1986}\cite{Sutton2003}\cite{Shaw2004}\cite{Guillemaud2010a}\cite{Patel2010}\cite{Kuriakose2017}\cite{Shapiro2017}\cite{Saidak2018}\cite{Miguelanez-Medran2019}\cite{Saidak2019} that the reason of positive/close surgical margin is possibly due to tumor aggressiveness or dispersion (WPOI-5) instead of iatrogenic reason of surgery. The surgical margin status is suggested as an independent surrogate for tumor dispersion, and important in the \acrshort{hnscc} study. Thus, in the current study, we selected the common clinicopathological features, including gender, age, clinical T, clinical N, clinical M, surgical margin status, and tobacco exposure in the biomarker discovery for adjustment of confounders (details description at Materials and Methods section).

In our previous work, altered glucose metabolism (e.k.a. the Warburg effect\cite{Warburg1956}) promotes the progression of \acrshort{hnscc}, which is partially attributed to the \acrfull{slc2a4} (or \acrfull{glut4}) and \acrfull{trim24} pathway\cite{Chang2017b}. In this study, LOC148709 (a \acrfull{lncrna}) was suggested as a biomarker of \acrshort{hnscc} (see Table \ref{table:table3}).
%on page \pageref{table:table3}). I
It was also found to has a contribution to the Warburg effect on esophagus cancer\cite{Liu2019}. 

There is a trend toward cancer type-agnostic study. The success of pembrolizumab and nivolumab was based on a common biomarker (e.g., \acrshort{pd1}) crossing several types of cancer.
It showed a precedent of tumor type-agnostic therapy\cite{Yan2018}.
%*** PD-L1/PD-L2 is a biomarker; Keynote-012
Currently, there are several common biomarkers of \acrshort{ici} under evaluation, which include \acrfull{til}, \acrfull{ifng}, and \acrfull{tmb}\cite{Gavrielatou2020}.
The other  \acrshort{ici}, anti-\acrshort{lag3} (pelatlimab), is currently evaluated under the phase I/IIA\cite{Cristina2019}\linebreak
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01968109) and II-IVA\cite{Neal2019} (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04080804) studies.

Although we combined the power of genome-wide scanning and an optimal cutoff finder for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the study has some limitations. We are aware of the importance of direct assessment of protein products comprising the basic functional units in cancer cells' biological processes. The announcement of the Cancer Proteome Atlas (\acrshort{tcpa}, http://tcpaportal.org) excited the cancer research community\cite{Li2013c}\cite{Li2017b}. By the utility of the \acrfull{rppa} or \acrfull{rpma}, a microarray of "Western blots" in the \acrshort{tcpa} could help to test our hypotheses.
However, there are only 237 antibodies available so far. We found that our candidates are not included in the \acrshort{tcpa} database (v3.0\cite{Chen2019}) yet. %  USP-10 in HPA

The Human Protein Atlas project (HPA) Proteome analysis is based on26941 antibodies targeting 17165 unique proteins. The HPA's Pathology Atlas analyzes each protein in patients, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis based on tissue microarrays (TMAs) adopted from TCGA. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses are based on RNA-Seq expression levels of human genes in HNSCC tissue and the clinical outcome.
All transcriptomics data has been retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and all proteomics data has been generated in-house using the same antibodies.
Our candidates (DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, STIP1, DKC1) are also on the list of unfavorable prognostic genes for HNSCC from \acrfull{hpa} (available at https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/pathology/head+and+neck+cancer, Version: 20.0 updated: 2020-11-19). The ZNF557, ZNF266, and FCGBP are on the list of favorable prognostic genes as well.

Pang et al.\cite{Pang2018} demonstrated that upregulation of DKK1 in SBC-3 cells (human small cell lung cancer) enhanced their proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as bone metastasis in vivo. 
Increased DKK1 levels in HNSCC tissues correlated with elevated VEGF-C and beta-catenin\cite{Shi2014}.
DKK1 expression was significantly associated with smoking, alcohol abuse, sex, human papillomavirus status\cite{Chakraborty2020}, tumor site, tumor invasion, and pathologic stage in HNSCC patients.\cite{Gao2018}.
The mRNA expression of DKK1 and DKK3 was elevated in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC\cite{Hu2020}. Overexpression of DKK1 indicates adverse OS in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA)\cite{Wei2020}, HNSCC\cite{Chakraborty2020}\cite{Hu2020}\cite{Wei2020}, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD)\cite{Wei2020}. %Moreover, DKK1 is increased in HPV\+ HNSCC, leading to the worst prognosis of the patients.

%FOXA2
Prognostic signature integrated of DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinical information provides a prognostic prediction value for HNSCC patients. 
FOXA2 is significantly associated with the poor prognosis of HNSCC through the studies of CpG-based DNA methylation and RNA expression approach\cite{Shen2017a}.

%A multi-stage screening strategy => univariate Cox regression was used to evaluate their association with overall survival in the training set, which identified 15 CpG sites with P < 0.05. Further, SIS analysis was performed to further screen out a stable probe combination.

Our strategy still has the strength to explore the more possible biomarkers from \acrshort{rnaseq} datasets in cancer research.
% second limitation:
In line with tumor-agnostic research, we plan to explore more TCGA diseases to find common biomarkers. However, the \acrshort{gdc} provided standardized data frames that could not directly fit our workflow's scope. Before the global genes scanning process, we needed to re-format, transpose and, merge the 528 patients' clinical datasets and correlated 20,500 expressions of bio-specimen. It should be carefully curated to confirm the data integrity with the correct definition. We also plan to upgrade our plain R script at the Rstudio platform to program in the C++ language and source it in R. The high performance of C++ could speed up the cutoff finding engine in this workflow involving heavy computations\cite{Woodward2020}. Thus, it is possible to introduce the Rstudio Shiny app (https://shiny.rstudio.com) as a web application of the "pvalueTex" packaged with our workflow in the future.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods} % 4

\subsection{Patient Cohort} 

The Cancer Genome Atlas (\acrshort{tcga}) profiled 528 \acrshort{hnscc} clinical and genomic data, which has been standardized and available at a unified data portal, \acrfull{gdc} of the \acrfull{nci}.
%\cite{SeanDavis;MartinMorgan2020}
GDC is available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-HNSC.
\acrshort{tcga} offers several computational tools to the public for facilitating cancer research.
Broad \acrfull{gdac} Firebrowse (firebrowse.org, version 1.1.35, 2016\_09\_27) is one of those tools to provide data access to each \acrshort{tcga} disease through a \acrfull{rest} \acrfull{api}.
The 528 \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} patients' clinical information and \acrshort{rnaseq} data were obtained from the Firebrowse \acrshort{rest}ful \acrshort{api} with an R package, FirebrowseR (available at https://github.com/mariodeng/\linebreak
FirebrowseR)\cite{Deng2017}. 
We utilized FirebrowseR with our analysis workflow (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, step 1) to receive standardized data frames while avoiding data re-formatting, often causing some errors.

\subsubsection{RNA Sequencing Data} 

The number of protein-coding genes was suggested as 20,500\cite{Clamp2007}. The \acrshort{gdc} Data Portal provided \acrshort{tcga} data has been harmonized and re-aligned \acrlong{rnaseq} data against an official reference genome build (\acrlong{grch38}, \acrshort{grch38}). \acrshort{rnaseq} expression level read counts produced by Illumina HiSeq have been normalized using the \acrfull{fpkm} method, as described in reference\cite{FPKM2017}.
The \acrshort{rnaseq} preprocessor of Broad \acrshort{gdac} picked the \acrfull{rsem} value from Illumina HiSeq/GA2 messenger \acrshort{rnaseq} level\_3 (v2) dataset of \acrshort{nci} \acrshort{gdc}. It made the messenger \acrshort{rnaseq} matrix with log2 transformed for the downstream analysis, as described in their reference\cite{RSEM2016}.
We utilized FirebrowseR's function call, Samples.mRNASeq(cohort = "HNSC", gene=GeneName, format="csv"), to download each \acrshort{rnaseq} data of all \acrshort{hnscc} patients and to save as 20,499 data frame files, named as "HNSCC.mRNA.Exp.[GeneName].\newline
Fire.Rda".
After careful investigation of the genomics dataset, the \acrshort{rnaseq} values of "\acrfull{slca}" and "\acrfull{slcb}" should be considered two distinct expression entities. We concluded that the number of protein-coding genes in the \acrshort{tcga} dataset is 20,500. We removed null expressed genes, which over 50\% of the cohort, to avoid the useless result.

\subsubsection{Clinical Data} 

We utilized FirebrowseR's function call, Samples.Clinical(cohort = "HNSC", format="csv"), to get all 81 clinical features (including pathological data, defined by \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{gdc} data dictionary: \acrfull{cde}\cite{CDE2019}) of all 528 \acrshort{hnscc} patients, which saved as one data frame file: "HNSCC.clinical.\linebreak
Fire.Rda" (accessed November 2019).

One "HNSCC.clinical.Fire.Rda" tables and 20,500 "HNSCC.mRNA.Exp.\newline
[GeneName].Fire.Rda" tables were transposed and merged by their \newline
\_participant\_barcode (unique patient \acrlong{id}, \acrshort{id}) to yield a data frame with 528 rows (participants) against 20,581 columns (81 clinical features as well as 20,500 protein-coding \acrshort{rnaseq} of cancer specimen).
The clinicopathological features selected for our workflow included gender, age, clinical tumor size, clinical cervical lymph node metastases, clinical distant metastasis assessment, pathological surgical margin, and tobacco exposure with their corresponding survival data.
The tumor size (T), cervical lymph node metastases (N), and distal metastasis status (M) were classified according to \acrfull{ajcc}\cite{Amin2017} along with \acrfull{uicc}\cite{Brierley2016} \acrshort{tnm} system for clinical staging of \acrshort{hnscc}.
% In the Eighth Edition, the AJCC has expanded the use of non-anatomic prognostic factors and biomarkers in assigning prognostic stage groups.
We made data clean by removing duplicated rows and columns.


\subsection{Cutoff Finder Core Engine}

%\label{key:cutoff}
To evaluate the effect of gene expression on the patient's survival, we introduced the stratifying of patients with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis according to each gene's low/high expression.
Our cutofFinder\_func subroutine employs the minimum P-value approach to recognizing cutoff points in continuous gene expression measurement for patients sub-population.
First, patients were ordered by \acrshort{rnaseq} value (RSEM) of a given gene. Next, patients were stratified at a serial cut (counted by person ranked in 30\% to 70\% percentile of the cohort; please see Figure \ref{fig:figure1} "HNSCC cohort"). The survival risk differences of the two groups were estimated by log-rank test to yield around 165 Kaplan-Meier P-values for each gene.
Then, the optimal cutoff of \acrshort{rnaseq}, giving the minimum P-value, was selected by the cutofFinder\_func subroutine.
This iteration method could calculate all possible cutoff of each gene expression in this cohort. At each run of cutofFinder\_func function call for an individual gene, it returned an optimal cutoff value (e.x. 0.027 for gene \acrlong{CAMK2N1}, \acrshort{CAMK2N1}). The optimal cutoff value and its correlated patient grouping size (e.x. low-expression in 262 persons vs. high-expression in 152 persons with gene \acrshort{CAMK2N1}) would be returned to the main program to allow downstream Cox survival analysis. The percentile range we applied as 30\% to 70\% was used to avoid a small grouping effect\cite{Miller1982}\cite{Mizuno2009a}.
In case there was no significant P-value, a median expression of this gene was set as its cutpoint as usual.

\subsection{Statistical Consideration}

Our workflow has loops to call function survival\_marginSFP(GeneName) with given GeneName to process the survival analysis gene by gene.
We dichotomized the clinicopathological features, which includes gender (male/ female), age at diagnosed (below/beyond 65 year-old), clinical tumor size (T1-2/T3-4), clinical nodal status (negative/positive), clinical distant metastasis (negative/positive), TNM staging (early/late), surgical margin status (negative/positive) and tobacco exposure (low/high). The patients were grouped by an \acrshort{rnaseq} value of each gene, cut at low- or high-expression on an optimal P-value obtained from the cutofFinder\_func subroutine (see the section of "Cutoff Finder Core Engine"). Pearson's chi-square test was used for these binary variables. Kaplan-Meier survival was analyzed using the log-rank test for two groups OS comparison.
The Cox proportional hazards regression is the widely accepted approach for modeling survival while accounting for confounding factors\cite{Magen2019}. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression model\cite{Andersen1982}, using the "coxph" function in R package "survival", was applied to calculate hazard ratio, \acrfull{ci95} and its significance, and to estimate the independent contributions of each clinicopathological features to the OS.
Results were considered statistically significant when a two-sided P-value $<$ 0.05, or a lower threshold if indicated.
The \acrfull{fdr} ($< 0.05$) could be used to pick up the optimal P-value to ensure the control for type I error of the Kaplan-Meier survival test during the cutoff finding procedure.
%statistical inference problems in biomedical and genomic data analysis routinely involve the simultaneous test of thousands, or even millions, of null hypotheses. Examples
There were also multiple correlated tests of null hypotheses in the Kaplan-Meier family during our global scanning of protein-coding genes. The stringent Bonferroni correction could result in an adjusted P-value to ensure the control for type I error. 
%There were multiple correlated tests in the family of Kaplan-Meier survival hypotheses during our global scanning of protein-coding genes. The stringent Bonferroni correction could result in an adjusted P-value to ensure the control for type I error. 

The resulting data, including Kaplan-Meier curves, cumulative P-value plots, and Cox regression tables, were exported to ".xlsx" and ".Rda" files (by R package "r2excel") for subsequent biomarker selection.


\subsection{Biomarker Selection}

Those genes with prognostic impact, whose hazard ratio $>=1.5$ or $<=0.5$ in both Cox's univariate/multivariate model, were assigned as provisional candidates.
Bonferroni adjusted (Kaplan-Meier) P-value was used to make a ranking of candidates for the final decision (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, step 2).

\section{Conclusions} % 5


Our findings suggested 20 candidate biomarkers, DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, DKC1, as well as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB, are all heavily associated with the prognosis of \acrshort{os} under optimal cutoff points with stringent Bonferroni P-values and proper confounders control. They also might be potential common biomarkers for subsequent study.
We wish this bioinformatics tool will be available for the broad usage of tumor-agnostic research\cite{Looney2020} to cross several \acrshort{tcga} diseases to make translational impacts. %Tex: PvalueTex
