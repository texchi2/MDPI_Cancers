Survival analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It is necessary to determine a cutoff point by patients' dichotomization for the continuous gene expression. We have used a workflow to perform biomarker discovery. It includes data retrieval, data pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling.
Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes and adjusted them with confounders, and Bonferroni corrected \textit{P} value. After validation with an independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837), the result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. 
Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.
We suggest these ten genes could be the candidates in biomarker discovery of HNSCC.

\section{Introduction}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (\acrshort{hnscc}), including oral, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal origin, is the fourth leading cancer causes of death for males in Taiwan\cite{MOHW_death2017}. The age-standardized incidence rate of \acrshort{hnscc} in males is 42.43 per 100,000 persons\cite{MOHW_incidence2018}. 
% chemotherapy => systemic therapy
The treatment strategies of \acrshort{hnscc} are surgery alone, systemic therapy with concurrent radiation therapy (systemic therapy/\acrshort{rt}), or surgery with adjuvant systemic therapy/\acrshort{rt} (according to \acrlong{nccn}, \acrshort{nccn} Clinical Practice Guidelines in \acrshort{hnscc}, Version 2.2020)\cite{Pfister2020a}. Despite the improvement in those interventions, the survival of \acrshort{hnscc} has improved only marginally over the past decade worldwide\cite{hpa2019}. The critical advancement of targeted therapy and immuno-oncology should benefit from emerging prognostic  biomarkers guiding modern systemic therapy.




%% TP53 gene => p53 protein; mutation of TP53
Accumulative knowledge showed that some biomarkers have prognostic significance in \acrshort{hnscc}. For example, node-negative \acrshort{hnscc} patients with p53 overexpression were found to hold lower survival\cite{DeVicente2004}.
Overexpression of \acrfull{hif}-1 alpha\cite{Aebersold2001} or Ki-67\cite{Couture2002} was found to be correlated with poor response to radiotherapy of \acrshort{hnscc}. The \acrfull{egfr}\cite{O-Charoenrat2000}\cite{Bentzen2005} and \acrfull{mmp}\cite{Harrington2017} were found to be overexpressed to promote invasion and metastasis of \acrshort{hnscc}.
From 2000 to 2006, the first anti-\acrshort{egfr} antibody-drug (cetuximab) has been developed and combined with radiotherapy, known as bio-\acrshort{rt}, to increase survival of unresectable locoregionally advanced disease\cite{Bonner2006a}.
The systemic therapy of cetuximab plus platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy (EXTREME regimen) has improved overall survival when given as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Vermorken2008}\cite{Rivera2009}. It has been approved by the \acrshort{us} \acrfull{fda} since 2008. In advance, the bio-\acrshort{rt} could be proceeded with \acrfull{tpf} induction chemotherapy to overcome  radio-resistance of \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Blanchard2013}.

However, Rampias and his colleagues\cite{Rampias2014} suggested that \acrfull{hras} mutations could mediate cetuximab resistance in systemic therapy of \acrshort{hnscc} via the \acrshort{egfr}/\acrfull{ras}/\acrfull{erk} signaling pathway.
After that, the \acrshort{egfr} \acrfull{tki} was introduced to help cetuximab in 2018. The anti-tumor activity was observed in a phase 1 trial for \acrshort{hnscc} patients using cetuximab and afatinib, a \acrshort{tki} of \acrshort{egfr}, \acrfull{her}2, and \acrshort{her}4\cite{Gazzah2018}. Other \acrshort{egfr} \acrshort{tki}s, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, osimertinib, were also developed to treat advanced \acrshort{hnscc}.
Although 90\% of \acrshort{hnscc} has overexpression of \acrshort{egfr}, cetuximab has only 10\% to 20\% response rate on those patients. So far, cetuximab is still the only drug of choice with proven efficacy, which has targeted the selected \acrshort{hnscc} patients\cite{Taberna2019}.

Until the immuno-oncology era, \acrfull{ici} was introduced since 2014 for treating \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Seiwert2014}\cite{Swanson2015}.
The \acrshort{ici} works on immune checkpoint molecules, including \acrfull{pd1}, \acrfull{ctla4}, \acrfull{tim3}, \acrfull{lag3}, \acrfull{tigit}, \acrfull{gitr}, and \acrfull{vista}\cite{Mei2020}.
The \acrshort{us} \acrshort{fda} has approved the anti-\acrshort{pd1} agents (e.g. pembrolizumab and nivolumab) as a monotherapy for the platinum-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Cramer2019}. 
According to the phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 study, \acrshort{pdl1} is a validated biomarker used in clinical guidance for candidate selection of pembrolizumab\cite{Burtness2019}\cite{Gavrielatou2020}.
However, because of the complexity of immune-tumor interaction, \acrshort{ici} has 20\% response rate to \acrfull{pdl1} expressed patients (over 50\% in \acrlong{ihc}, \acrshort{ihc} staining of \acrshort{hnscc})\cite{Swanson2015}\cite{Gavrielatou2020}.

According to our proteomic study between 2010 to 2017, \acrfull{tmsb4x} was reported to be related to tumor growth and metastasis of \acrshort{hnscc}\cite{Chi2017}. It was also reported by the subsequent investigations that \acrshort{tmsb4x} has engaged in tumor aggressiveness through \acrfull{emt} on pancreatic\cite{Zhang2008}, gastric\cite{Ryu2012}, colorectal\cite{Gemoll2015}, lung\cite{Huang2016}, ovarian\cite{Chu2019}, and melanoma\cite{Makowiecka2019} cancers. Thus, it might be suggested that \acrshort{tmsb4x}  is a candidate for tumor type-agnostic therapy\cite{Yan2018} as a common biomarker crossing several types of cancer.
%TMSB4X proteins regulate intracellular signal transduction and has been proved to overexpress in various cancers, including colorectal, lung, gastric, pancreatic, and squamous cell cancers.\cite{Chi2017}

% to summarize the advantages of its use.
The highlights of the advantages of applying the TCGA data for cancer biomarker identification include:
\begin{outline}
\1  To the best of our knowledge, the TCGA database is the largest collection (in both cancer types and cohort size) of comprehensive genomics with survival data available in the field of cancer research so far.  
There are many physical and social features of patients available for survival modeling. % ($X_1 ... X_n$)
The whole-genome sequencing data has been harmonized across all GDACs.  Many databases adopt the essential demographic data from TCGA since it has comprehensive clinical features, such as exposure to alcohol, asbestos, radioactive radon, tobacco smoking, or cigarettes.
\1  TCGA has a remarkable advantage for computational and life scientists who study cancer since useful web-based tools and API are ready to analyze and visualize TCGA data. It might be getting help quickly from the research community for trouble-shooting.
\1  Many achievements of diagnoses, treatments, and prevention with the TCGA data have already been published and keep growing\cite{Tomczak2015}.\\[0.5cm]

\subsubsection{From TCGA to expression biomarkers}

%% download data with offline analysis
Usually, investigators could download the TCGA data in order to analyze and find expression biomarkers.
A number of genes of interested could be differentially expressed between tumor samples obtained from those patients with better/worse survival of HNSCC.
A brief overview of steps:
\begin{outline}
\1 obtain the data (RNA-Seq and clinicopathological data): go to FireBrowse (firebrowse.org) or FireHose (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/), select "Clinical" and "mRNASeq" data of \acrfull{hnscc}
\1 prepare the data for the analysis
\1 run the analysis under the R package "survival", and interpret the results
\end{outline}

%%%%%% web-based tools
%Usually, 
The other investigators should get the rationale or revelation of the genes of interest on a specific cancer type. They should upload those genes manually onto bioinformatics tools, such as SurvExpress (http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx:8080/Biomatec/ \newline
SurvivaX.jsp\cite{Aguirre-Gamboa2013}, which has been lost since Oct/2019 and currently out of funds), and analyze the cohort (e.x. \acrshort{tcga}). After downloading the survival results, they could curate plots and tables carefully.
It is not possible to scan the whole human protein-coding genome in this way.
The web-based tools might set a cutpoint at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile for subsequent analyses. There are several visualization software or R packages which deal with cutoff determination\cite{Abel1984}, %CRITLEVEL
such as Prognoscan\cite{Mizuno2009a}, Cutoff Finder\cite{Budczies2012}, Findcut\cite{Chang2017a}, Human protein atlas\cite{Uhlen2017}, OptimalCutpoints\cite{Cristina2019},  cutpointr (available at https://github.com/thie1e/cutpointr), and cutoffR (available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/cutoffR). However, non of them could combine the scanning of the protein-coding genes and cutoff optimization programmatically.

%%% ***
In summary, identifying predictive biomarkers for selecting standard-of-care or advanced systemic therapy\cite{Cristina2019} in \acrshort{hnscc} is crucial.
\begin{MyColorPar}{red} %%%
There are two key-points of biomarker discovery from survival analysis of TCGA HNSCC dataset.
First, although \acrshort{tcga} genomics data has been harmonized, two things were found during our investigating and data cleaning:

\begin{outline}
\1 null expressed genes over 50\% of the cohort have been excluded in the workflow
\1 after extended organizing, the number of protein-coding genes in the  RNA-Seq dataset should be corrected  (from 20499 to 20500);

\begin{MyColorPar}{red} %%% %%%
% risk of 
Second, trying to find an optimal cutpoint of that \acrshort{rna} expression data to maximize candidate mining coverage, this strategy might identify more but weak "biomarkers". 
Thus, the false positives and adjustment of multiple comparisons should be corrected by \acrfull{fdr}.
%Exploring all possible expression cutoffs is controversial. A robust expression biomarker should be effective and detectable at most major cutoffs. 
%Compared to a fixed quantile cutoff, a sliding window cutoff selection of cutoffs would capture more genes whose p-values just reach the significant level (p=0.05). For example, a gene with a p-value of 0.1 at 25\% or 50\% quantile cutoff could achieve a p-value of 0.04 at 70\% quantile cutoff. But it is not expected that a gene with a p-value of 0.1 at 25\% or 50\% quantile cutoff could achieve a p-value of 1e-5 at 70\% quantile cutoff. 
\end{MyColorPar} %%%

Our approach describes a comprehensive workflow implemented in the R script, which runs on the Rstudio server.
Its function includes data retrieval, data preprocessing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker selection.
The workflow, shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, scanned 20,500 human protein-coding genes of the \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort to yield a model with biomarker estimate.

%We found that the surgical margin status and tobacco exposure are independent risk factors of patient survival. 
%Our findings also suggested several candidate biomarkers are associated with the prognosis of overall survival (OS) under optimal cutoff point with significant P-value. Those genes may be potential therapeutic targets of HNSCC.

The candidate selection performs 1) dissecting and selection of candidate genes by further Bonferroni adjusted \textit{P} values as well as a hazard ratio of Cox model, based on the results from the survival analyses;
2) survival analyses of the other HNSCC dataset (GSE6585) using Kaplan-Meier estimate (KM, with FDR correction) and Cox modeling (CoxHR).\\
The selected genes have been validated by third HNSCC cohort (GSE2837).

\section{Results}


The 9416 Kaplan-Meier plots with associated Cox's univariate and multivariate tables were generated by Cox modeling (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}) and justified by the ranking of hazard ratios.
The 967 genes were kept by criteria of uncorrected \textit{P} value (below 0.05) and \acrfull{hr} (greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5) (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(a) univariate, and Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(b) multivariate plots). 
At the final step, a stringent criteria (Bonferroni \textit{P} value correction) was used to yield twenty candidates (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(c), (d)). 
% before validation
Among these candidates, ten overexpressed genes (symbol as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of  \acrshort{os} (see Table \ref{tab:newTable1}). 
The other ten overexpressed genes (symbol as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival (see Table \ref{tab:newTable1}, with their gene name).
We made a volcano plot for 9416 genes by Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value (less than 0.05, obtained during cutoff finding procedure) against the Cox hazard ratio (see Figure \ref{fig:hazards3}). %{fig:figure3}). 
The plot reveals that the top 20 genes (Bonferroni-adjusted \textit{P} $< 0.05$) are located on the peaks. At the same time, Cox's HR separated them on the two-side with prognostic impact.
% => after validation: The result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

%注意 強調GSE2837: 
%The prognostic significance of the candidate genes has been validated by an independent patient cohort.

%\subsubsection*{GSE2837} % non-TCGA

%by GEO GSE2837 HNSCC dataset (PrognoScan)
After the discovery by our workflow, we validated the those 20 genes in the other independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837).
The survival significance (Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value) is in the following probes among 10 genes:\\
1) poor prognosis: CAMK2N1 (0.048214), PGK1 (0.009978), SURF4 (0.023127), USP10 (0.017768), NDFIP1 (0.022758), FOXA2 (0.001587);\\ % FOXA2 (0.038125)
2) better prognosis: IL19 (0.049731), FCGBP (0.005658), KIAA1683 (IQCN, 0.005886), NPB (0.014177);\\
%17 out of 20 candidates
%?DKK1 (0.253635), 
%Nevertheless, PrognoScan has group separation cut by a skewed manner, and the GSE2837 has far fewer participants than the TCGA cohort.
%DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, DKC1;
%ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, KIAA1683 (IQCN), NPB
%Those 11 genes achieve similar positive and negative prognostic effect comparable with our proposed candidate genes. 
Thus, these 10 candidates have been confirmed by a comparative study using the GSE2837 dataset other than the TCGA cohort. Please see Kaplan-Meier plots in Supplementary Figure S1.%\ref{fig:fig_GSE2837}.

After validated by GSE2837, our top 1 candidate is \acrfull{CAMK2N1}. The Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 152 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{CAMK2N1} were suffered from only 35\% of 5-year \acrshort{os} rate. In comparison, the other 262 patients with lower expression (the cutoff at 0.027(RSEM)) had a better prognosis (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$) (see Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(a)).
Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(b)'s cumulative \textit{P} value plot shows that the uncorrected 147 \textit{P} values ($< 0.05$) have been estimated by a serial cut from 144 to 290 persons for grouping the cohort in our cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R, see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, cutoff engine). The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{2.97e-7}), when cut on n=262 (63.3\% of 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value.
Conversely, the most associated gene with better survival is \acrfull{IL19}. In Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(c), a Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 215 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{IL19} had 60\% of 5-year OS survival rate (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$). The cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R) generated cumulative \textit{P} value plot in Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(d). The 161 uncorrected \textit{P} values were estimated by a serial cut from 125 to 286 for grouping the cohort. The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{3.73e-7}), when cut on n=199 (48.1\% of total cohort 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value with a cutoff value -0.147(RSEM) of \acrshort{rnaseq}.

after adjustment of confounders, \acrshort{CAMK2N1} overexpression is the independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR 2.007 [95\% CI: 1.490-2.704, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]), as well as clinical T stage (HR 1.982 [95\% CI: 1.048-3.745, \textit{P} = 0.035]) and surgical margins status (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.182-2.250, \textit{P} = 0.003]). 
Older age (more than 65) also worse the survival (HR 1.391 [95\% CI: 1.025-1.888, \textit{P} = 0.034]).

In Table \ref{tab:newTable1}, %{table:table3}, 
the other ten overexpressed genes have been found in better prognosis of \acrshort{hnscc} patients. Cox's univariate and multivariate HR is under 0.5.
Four out of ten has been validated by using GSE2837.
In Table \ref{table:table4},
after adjustment of confounders, prognosis is influenced by advance clinical T Status (HR 1.961 [95\% CI: 1.035-3.714, \textit{P} = 0.039] ), positive surgical margin involvement (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.18-2.254, \textit{P} = 0.003]) , and higher tobacco exposure (HR 1.453 [95\% CI: 1.055-2.000, \textit{P} = 0.022]).
Overexpressed \acrshort{IL19} gene could has a protective influencce on prognosis (HR 0.499 [95\% CI: 0.372-0.669, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]).


In summary, those ten candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc}.
Thus, the prognosis model with coefficients is established from \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort. 
%The important input $X_1...X_n$ should be patients' features: age, specific ten gene expressions, clinical T stage, and surgical margin.

% After validation with an independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837), the result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. 
%Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

\subsection{Feature Selection for Survival Modeling} % Even there are many $X_1 ... X_n$ physical and social features of patients available for survival modelling in the TCGA.
% TCGAbiolinks
%alcohol consumption
Besides ethnicity, age, gender, \acrshort{tnm} stage, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the comprehensive adversely prognostic features in \acrshort{hnscc} should also include tobacco exposure, \acrshort{egfr} amplification, \acrfull{hpv} status, positive/close surgical margin ($<5 mm$), \acrfull{ene}, \acrfull{lvsi}, \acrfull{pni}, \acrfull{doi} ($>5 mm$), as well as metastatic \acrfull{lnd}\cite{Cheraghlou2018}, and \acrfull{wpoi5}, which is defined as tumor dispersion (1 mm apart between tumor satellites) or positive \acrshort{pni}/\acrshort{lvsi}\cite{Amin2017}.
The features of \acrshort{doi}, \acrshort{lnd}, and tumor dispersion are not available on the \acrshort{tcga} dataset. The Brandwein-Gensler's risk model (lymphocytic host response, \acrshort{wpoi5}, and \acrshort{pni})\cite{Brandwein-Gensler2010}\cite{Sinha2018} has been suggested to be routinely performed on pathological examination. In previous reports of \acrshort{hnscc}, the loco-regional failure will be high when the initial frozen section has a positive/close surgical margin, and even the final margin revision revealed negative\cite{Bulbul2019b}.
According to Table \ref{table:table2} and Table \ref{table:table4} in our study, the positive surgical margin yields a hazard ratio greater than 1.6 to influence on patient's \acrshort{os}.
It is suggested by authors \cite{Scholl1986}\cite{Sutton2003}\cite{Shaw2004}\cite{Guillemaud2010a}\cite{Patel2010}\cite{Kuriakose2017}\cite{Shapiro2017}\cite{Saidak2018}\cite{Miguelanez-Medran2019}\cite{Saidak2019} that the reason of positive/close surgical margin is possibly due to tumor aggressiveness or dispersion (WPOI-5) instead of iatrogenic reason of surgery. The surgical margin status has also been suggested as an independent surrogate for tumor dispersion in the \acrshort{hnscc} study. Thus, we selected common clinicopathological features in the current biomarker discovery, including gender, age, clinical T, clinical N, clinical M, surgical margin status, and tobacco exposure, to adjust confounders (details description at Materials and Methods section).

%The Dickkopf1 (DKK1) gene encodes a protein mainly involved in Wnt and other signaling pathways. Inhibition of DKK1 in Hep-2 cells reduces their proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro\cite{Shi2014}. Pang et al.\cite{Pang2018} has proved that upregulation of DKK1 in SBC-3 cells (human small cell lung cancer) enhances their proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as bone metastasis in vivo. Increased DKK1 levels in HNSCC tissues is correlated with elevated VEGF-C and beta-catenin\cite{Shi2014}. DKK1 expression is significantly associated with smoking, alcohol abuse, human papillomavirus status\cite{Chakraborty2020}, tumor site, tumor invasion, and pathologic stage in HNSCC patients.\cite{Gao2018}. The mRNA expression of DKK1 and DKK3 is elevated in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC\cite{Hu2020}. Overexpression of DKK1 indicates adverse OS in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA)\cite{Wei2020}, HNSCC\cite{Chakraborty2020}\cite{Hu2020}\cite{Wei2020}, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD)\cite{Wei2020}. %Moreover, DKK1 is increased in HPV\+ HNSCC, leading to the worst prognosis of the patients.

%STC2:
%The miR-381 suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in the HNSCC SCC-4 cell line through targeting stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) and participates in HNSCC development probably via the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway\cite{Ma2020}.

% PGK1
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1 or PGK-1), a glycolysis enzyme, is responsive in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell line (H-1R). 
The resistance is associated with the up-regulated expression of PGK1, CD55, ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (e.g., MDR1, MRP1, and MRP2), and down-regulated expression Caveolin 1\cite{Nakamura2005}.
PGK1 is responsive in hypoxia status, since it is one of \acrshort{hif}-1 alpha regulated gene revealed in HNSCC\cite{Peng2011}\cite{Shih2017}.

%SURF4
The patients with tumors (such as glioma, breast cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, and sarcoma%; not HNSCC
) exhibiting high Surfeit gene 4 (SURF4) expression have significantly shorter overall survival than low SURF4 expression.
SURF4 can induce cellular transformation and cell migration in vitro and has increased tumor growth ability in vivo\cite{Kim2018a}.

% USP10
Ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 (USP10), one of the autophagy-related genes (ARGs), may serve as a prognostic biomarker and target for various human cancers, including epithelial ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and HNSCC\cite{Ren2020}.
Functional annotation - by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) - reveals that USP10 is significantly enriched in many critical pathways correlated with tumorigenesis of HNSCC, including the p53 pathway, IL-2–STAT5 signaling, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB or $TGF\beta$) signaling, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling\cite{Ren2020}.
% 13 ARGs (GABARAPL1, ITGA3, USP10, ST13, MAPK9, PRKN, FADD, IKBKB, ITPR1, TP73, MAP2K7, CDKN2A, and EEF2K) with prognostic value were identified in HNSCC patients

%FOXA2
Prognostic signature integrated of DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinical information could provide a prognostic prediction value for HNSCC patients. Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) is significantly associated with the poor prognosis of HNSCC through the studies of CpG-based DNA methylation and RNA expression approach\cite{Shen2017a}.
%32 HNSCC patients had both tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples in TCGA cohort, which was used as the discovery set to identify differential methylation CpG sites.

%A multi-stage screening strategy => univariate Cox regression was used to evaluate their association with overall survival in the training set, which identified 15 CpG sites with P < 0.05. Further, SIS analysis was performed to further screen out a stable probe combination. Seven of the 15 candidate CpGs were identified, including cg13495205, cg07110405, cg03774514, cg09137696, cg19655456, cg03146625, and cg21546671 (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Table S1), mapped to AJAP1, SHANK2, FOXA2, MT1A, ZNF570, HOXC4, and HOXB4, respectively.

Although we combine the power of genome-wide scanning and an optimal cutoff finder for survival analysis, the study has some limitations.
% first limitation:
We are aware of the importance of direct assessment of protein products comprising the basic functional units in cancer cells' biological processes.

In line with tumor-agnostic research, we plan to explore common biomarkers crossing TCGA diseases. However, the \acrshort{gdc} provided standardized data frames that could not directly fit our workflow's scope. Before the global genes scanning process, it is necessary to re-format, transpose and, merge the 528 patients' clinical datasets and correlated 20,500 expressions of bio-specimen. This process should be carefully curated to confirm the data integrity within the correct definition\cite{Rendleman2019}. We also plan to upgrade our R script of the cutoff engine to the C++ language and source it in the Rstudio server. The high performance of C++ could speed up the critical steps in this workflow involving heavy computation of matrix data\cite{Woodward2020}. Moreover, it is possible to introduce the Rstudio Shiny app (https://shiny.rstudio.com) as a web-based tool (named "pvalueTex" ) packaged with our workflow in the future.

World Health Organisation has called worldwide for delivering people-centred (or person-centred) care from the physical, emotional, socioeconomic, and spiritual perspectives\cite{WHO2015}\cite{Ling-ChengMong2021}.
Core principles can be taken to achieve people-centred and integrated health service delivery. 
The first principle is holistic – focusing on physical, socioeconomic, mental, and emotional well-being. 
Holistic care has been defined that care and sees the person as a whole with psychological, social, and environmental levels of needs and goals.
%that considers  factors rather than just the symptoms of disease or ill-health.
The second principle is empowering – supporting people to manage and take responsibility for their health,
%Empowerment: the process of supporting people and communities to take control of their own health needs resulting, 
for example, in the uptake of healthier behaviors or the ability to self-manage illnesses.
People-centred care requires that people have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their care.
%Glossary:
%People-centred care: an approach to care that consciously adopts individuals’, carers’, families’ and communities’ perspectives as participants in, and beneficiaries of, trusted health systems that respond to their needs and preferences in humane and holistic ways. People-centred care also requires that people have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care. It is organized around the health needs and expectations of people rather than diseases (7,8)

{\\Beyond carcinogenesis - Under the mind-brain-body axis, a stressful environment (giant \textcolor{black}{black} arrow) will trigger emotional reception. The subconscious mind (brain) will release stress hormones and inflammation signals in response to the emotion. The physical body's internal environment (cells) alters epigenetic control in gene regulation and mRNA expression. In a long incubation time, the tissue/cells will be transformed into dysplasia then malignancy (e.x. HNSCC) with helping from known carcinogens.\\
Cancer care - Holistic care should take care of cancer patients' spiritual, emotional, physical, and socioeconomic needs. Physical care will be carried out by medication therapy or surgery. After establishing a therapeutic relationship (TR), the physicians' spiritual properties (empathy, sympathy, and compassion) will engage their patients and recover their self-compassion to gain resilience against the disease through their mind-brain-body axis.
Thus, we suggest electric healthcare records (EHR) include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information. The \acrshort{tcga} should collect "holistic features" as well (\textcolor{green}{green} dashed line).}

A systematic review of spiritually based interventions and psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcomes in breast cancer survivorship was reported by Hulett et al.\cite{Hulett2016}. 
%Objective This is a review of spiritually based interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction, MBSR) that utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought to examine the evidence regarding relationships between spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer survivors. 
%Methods A systematic search of 9 online databases was conducted for articles of original research, peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer selected questions regarding relationships between psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized in spiritually based interventions.

%Compared with control groups, intervention groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although limitations exist. %Design methods have improved with regard to increased use of comparison groups compared with previous reviews. There are few spiritually based interventions that specifically measure religious or spiritual constructs. Similarly, there are few existing studies that utilize standardized religious or spiritual measures with PNI outcome measures. 
Findings suggest that mindfulness meditation could stabilize neuroendocrine-immune activity (measured by PNI biomarkers) in breast cancer patients comparing to control groups\cite{Hulett2016}.
%This review revealed a positive pattern between spiritually-based interventions and several PNI biomarker outcomes, suggesting that spiritually-based interventions offer positive mental and physiological health benefits. 
%For breast cancer survivors, these studies suggested that engaging in spiritually-based practices may improve or stabilize the immune profile dysregulation that occurs with breast cancer.\cite{Hulett2016}.
%From a PNI perspective, future spiritually based interventions should include standardized measures of religiousness and spirituality in order to understand relationships between and among religiousness, spirituality, and neuroendocrine-immune outcomes.

%Mindfulness based stress reduction provides psychological benefit and restores immune function of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer: A randomized trial with active control.
%BACKGROUND: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer experience psychological distress, accompanied by reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) and altered levels of cytokines, which may compromise cancer control. Few studies have evaluated psycho-immune outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in comparison to an active control condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether MBSR benefits psychological, behavioral, and immunological function in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: After confirmation of breast cancer staging, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (n = 192) were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or an 8-week active control condition (ACC). The ACC consisted of a series of cancer recovery and health education classes. Both MBSR and the ACC were administered in group format. METHODS: Women completed psychometric instruments and provided blood for NKCA and cytokine levels at pre-, mid-, and completion of program, as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. One hundred and twenty four women completed all five-assessments (MBSR, n = 63; ACC, n = 61). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze trajectories of outcomes over time and between groups. 
%RESULTS: Compared to the ACC group, women randomized to MBSR exhibited decreasing trajectories of perceived stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms. 
%Further, compared to women randomized to ACC, MBSR women exhibited trajectories demonstrating significantly more rapid restoration of NKCA, accompanied by 
%lower circulating TNF-alpha levels, lower IL-6 production =>  pro-inflammatory cytokines
%and greater IFN-gamma production => IFN gamma supports an immune-mediated response against cancer and this may be important during the transition following cancer treatment
A randomized clinical trial with active control proved that early provision of MBSR for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer provides psychological benefits (reduction of stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms), and also optimizes immune functions (higher natural killer cell activity, higher \acrshort{ifng}, lower TNF-alpha, lower IL-6) supportive of cancer survival\cite{WitekJanusek2019}.



%%%% PCA and ECA: the way to delivery of MBSR
The therapeutic relationship (TR) is essential towards spiritual care.
According to clinical experience in healthcare, sometimes patients could tell the physicians: "How amazing it is. I want to talk about myself more when I visit this doctor whom I trust."
In 1979, Carl Rogers wrote\cite{Rogers1979}: "I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then whatever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful."
Carl Rogers developed person-centered theory that the therapist is providing the appropriate social-environmental conditions for their patients\cite{Rogers1957}\cite{Joseph2004}\cite{Griffiths2013}.
Person-centred theory holds that the innate tendency towards growth and development is facilitated by the six conditions described by Rogers in 1957\cite{Rogers1957}:\\
%For constructive personality change to occur, it is necessary that these conditions exist and continue over a period of time: 
1. Two persons are in psychological contact. \\
2. The first, whom we shall term the client, is in a state of incongruence (or not harmony), being vulnerable or anxious. \\
3. The second person, whom we shall term the therapist, is congruent
or integrated with the relationship. \\
4. The therapist experiences "unconditional positive regard" for the client. \\
5. The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's
internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experience to the client. \\
6. The communication to the client of the therapist's empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard is to a minimal degree achieved.\\

%As a person with hemophilia (PWH), my passion led me to conduct personal research to uncover the main cause of my drawbacks in my education, my career, and my romantic life. I have experienced unjustified conflicts in my social relations, feeling stale in mind and body
%Findings: Through my research, I uncovered that I used to suffer from what I call 'mind inhibitors' these were the hidden cause of my life disorders and spontaneous bleeds. These mind inhibitors are responsible for locking the body factor receptors, blocking body energy centres (like the solar plexus), discouraging the super-intelligent body cells from running their auto-healing system, and paralyzing the instinctive high-speed cellular response to external molecular treatment. 
%Mind inhibitors originate from different sources like thinking of oneself in a victim role, anxiety about medical treatments, lack of financial stability, negative attitudes, self-rejection, and contradictory thoughts and feelings. 
%Conclusion: Mind inhibitors should be handled as seriously as biological inhibitors. As Dr. Bruce Lipton explains in his book, 'The Biology of Belief'\cite{Lipton2015}: DNA does not control our biology; instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell. Our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking, since thoughts are made of energy that affects the cellular energy level, and thus everything is created twice: once in our minds and then the physical creation follows. % 萬法唯心造
Holistic healthcare should be considered for treating patients as a complete synchronized system of soul, mind, and body; treatment should include more than medication or surgery, but a holistic approach would also address the patient's need for a subconscious paradigm shift in the person's thought and belief system.\cite{Kobisi2012}\cite{Lipton2015}

In 1772, Willian Cullen, a British physician, wrote that  "I own that I did not trust much to it, but I gave it because it is necessary to give a medicine, and as what I call a placebo. If I had thought of any internal medicine, it would have been a dose of the Dover's powders (made up of Ipecac and opium)."\cite{Kerr2008}\cite{Finniss2018}
Cullen studied the objective science of analytical chemistry. He also studied that the patient's therapeutic response could be influenced by his
subjective, psychosomatic, or "sympathetic constitution"\cite{Kerr2008}.
%Cullen developed a theory of "sympathy" (or empathy) which informed his ideas about clinical medicine dealing with the psychosomatic theory of illness and mind-body therapeutics. % he do 炮製
Cullen's theory of sympathy (or empathy) is a mind-body therapeutics, a kind of "vital force" that animated the human body, joint function, and transmitted sensation to target organs\cite{Forget2003}\cite{Kerr2008}.
%This finely calibrated, rational use of active placebo treatment, in which the physician-dispensed weak, physiologically active substance in order to please and calm the patient rather than to cure the patient's underlying disorder, was a product of the rational scientific culture of the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and its embrace of a grounded, empirical approach to medicine. %啟蒙運動

Pain researchers are united in the belief that placebo analgesia is real, in the sense that the neural processes that represent pain are reduced in neuroimaging studies\cite{Bennett2018}. 
The anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the brain have been found to be activated by placebo administration\cite{Benedetti2005}\cite{Benedetti2011}\cite{Carlino2011}\cite{Bennett2018}.

The genetics of the cell gives all kinds of potentials. % 自性空
Environmental signals from the cell membrane can go into the nucleus via signal transduction. The signal selectively changes the reading of our gene, e.g., epigenetics regulation, controlling cell behaviors.% including genetics.
The central dogma of molecular biology should be modified as environmental signals to regulatory protein to DNA to RNA and then to protein.
Epigenetics control says that genetic expression is directly due to the environment of our cells and our perception of the environment\cite{Gustafson2017} (e.x. stressful environment, see Figure \ref{fig:figure5}).
% so do the cancer
%Individual treatment and avoiding assumptions. Although it is useful for therapists to have a knowledge of the trauma literature on the general reactions of people who experience trauma, the therapist should not assume that this knowledge necessarily applies to each and every client\cite{Joseph2004}.
%The membrane proteins and the chromosomal proteins that control the DNA, called regulatory proteins. But even those proteins are controlled by environmental signals. %It is not DNA to RNA to protein.
%療癒 
Study showed that after several hours of meditation, the expression of some inflammatory genes changed\cite{Gustafson2017}.
%You can change your genetic activity by how you change your response to the environment. 
%to recognize your perceptions, via signal transduction, are translated into biological behavior and your genetic activity.
Becoming aware of our behavior's subconscious source allows us to change our lives by rewriting the programs (in the subconscious mind) of limitation or the things that interfere with us.
Warburg effect\cite{Warburg1956}\cite{Chang2017b} is an example of carcinogenesis and metabolic reprogramming of cells by some environmental factors.
%honeymoon by Lipton 愛自己就是渡蜜月；其實是 正念 mindfulness (因為自他不二）
%You are creating a world of joy and love, and that’s called the honeymoon. When we fall in love, we stop focusing our conscious mind in thought and start keeping it present. 
%It is called being mindful. 
%You’ve been looking for yourself your whole life.
%愛、性、正念止觀
%Science has recognized that immediately after falling in love, we enter a period of mindfulness where we keep our conscious mind present.
%You start running programs that are based on your conscious wishes and desires. All of a sudden, without the programs—without the subconscious programs—we begin to experience a heavenly life.
%%%%%% carcinogenesis
%95\% of cognitive behavior runs on subconscious program:
%70\% %對於健康有不良影響 => 卻是惡劣競爭下的生存技能
%Of the downloaded behaviors acquired before age 7, the vast majority—70\% or more—are programs of limitation, disempowerment, and self-sabotage. These programs were acquired from other people, not from ourselves, with a survival advantage.
%Being subconscious, those programs acquired from other people before age 7, are occurring without conscious recognition and awareness. 
The survival advantage programs, such as limitation, disempowerment, and self-sabotage, will affect epigenetic regulation.
Genes are not self-actualizing. %The control of genes is not due to any inherent activity in the DNA itself. 
The regulation of genetic activity is due to the interaction of the cell with environmental signals.
%Less than 1\% of disease is associated with genetics. 
Over 90\% of disease is a total reflection of the environment.% and especially our programming.
%the disempowering, self-sabotaging behaviors that we acquired in the first 7 years.
%the cell membrane through receptors picking up the signals and translating them into biology, which then sends signals into the nucleus, which then controls the genetic activity.
The mind-brain-body axis shows that subconscious fear causes releasing of inflammatory and stress hormones from the brain in terms of cell alteration in DNA methylation, mutation, mRNA expression. 
%Carcinogenesis will occur if the reprogramming is persistent for a longer time.
Moreover, long-term stress could be correlated with cancer metastasis\cite{Lutgendorf2010}\cite{Moreno-Smith2010}\cite{Du2020}\cite{Xu2021},
and cancer initiation\cite{Lutgendorf2010}\cite{Powell2013}\cite{Iftikhar2021}.(see Figure \ref{fig:figure5}) %HNSCC
Adverse psychosocial experiences in early life, such as child maltreatment, caregiver stress, and community violence, have been associated in epidemiological studies with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and psychiatric illnesses. 
The possible molecular mechanisms could be also related with the mind-brain-body axis\cite{Berens2017}.
%Additional work has shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms by which early adversity becomes "biologically embedded" in altered physiology across body systems.\cite{Berens2017}

%%%%%% revision1 added [TCGA] [2021/02/02] %$X_1 ... X_n$ of independent features
A large-scale cancer database, aggregating many independent features, is necessary to facilitate the biomarker discovery.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project\cite{Weinstein2013} has been developed since 2005 and supervised by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), funded by the US government.
TCGA represents comprehensive genomics and clinic data from 84,392 patients among 33 major cancer types (data release 27.0 - Oct 29, 2020, available at https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers).
%The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): The TCGA consortium, which is a National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative, makes publicly available molecular and clinical information for more than 33 types of human cancers including exome (variant analysis), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), DNA methylation, transcriptome (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and proteome.
TCGA and other collaborated \acrfull{gdac} generated and analyzed DNA (mutation, copy number variation, methylation, simple nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), RNA (microarray, RNA-Seq, microRNA), and protein (reverse protein phased array) data derived from biospecimen. Sample types available at TCGA are primary solid tumors, recurrent solid tumors, blood-derived normal and tumor, metastatic, and solid tissue normal.  

The NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC, available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) receives, processes, and distributes genomic, clinical, and biospecimen data from TCGA database and other cancer research programs. The clinical features has been defined by \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{gdc} data dictionary: \acrfull{cde}\cite{CDE2019}. The \acrshort{rnaseq} expression data has been harmonized and re-aligned against an official reference genome build (\acrlong{grch38}, \acrshort{grch38}).
%The old TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/tcga/) stops updating and all TCGA data was transferred to the GDC data portal .
\acrshort{tcga}, GDC and some research communities offer several computational tools to the public for facilitating cancer research. %There is three categories of tools to approach the TCGA data from GDC.
GDC Data Portal is the official web-based TCGA data analysis tools. Other available web-based tools have been reviewed by Zhang et al.\cite{Zhang2019b} and 
Matthieu Foll (availalbe at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/awesome-TCGA).
One of \acrshort{gdac}s, the Broad TCGA Data and Analyses (Broad GDAC), provides Firehose, a repository of the TCGA public-accessible Level 3 data and Level 4 analyses. Broad GDAC Firehose is an analytical infrastructure that analyses algorithms not performed by the GDC (e.x. GISTIC, MutSig2CV, correlation with clinical variables, mRNA clustering). 
A web-based version of Broad GDAC Firehose is Firebrowse (available at firebrowse.org, Version: 1.1.40, 2019-10-13).
%Python and UNIX bindings
%R bindings
Broad GDAC Firebrowse provides graphical tools like viewGene to explore expression levels and iCoMut to explore a mutation analysis of each TCGA disease. 

%Second, GDC data transfer tool (available at https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool) allows users to access the open or controlled data. %the GDC data model, data formats
% RESTful API
\end{MyColorPar}

GDC \acrfull{api} is designed under the \acrfull{rest} architecture and provides accessibility to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality found through GDC Portals. Those functions include searching, viewing, submitting, and downloading subsets of data files, metadata, and annotations based on specific parameters. Moreover, if restricted data is requested, the user must provide a token along with the API call. This token can be downloaded directly from the GDC Portals. (paragraph is provided here courtesy of the National Cancer Institute)
% Articles from Cureus are provided here courtesy of Cureus Inc.
Broad GDAC Firebrowse \acrshort{rest}ful \acrshort{api} could be accessed using an R package, FirebrowseR (available at https://github.com/mariodeng/FirebrowseR)\cite{Deng2017}.

% clinical
%We utilized FirebrowseR's function call, Samples.Clinical(cohort = "HNSC", format="csv"), to get all 81 clinical features (including pathological data, defined by \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{gdc} data dictionary: \acrfull{cde}\cite{CDE2019}) of all 528 \acrshort{hnscc} patient.


GDC is available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-HNSC.
\acrshort{tcga} offers several computational tools to the public for facilitating cancer research.
Broad \acrfull{gdac} Firebrowse (firebrowse.org, version 1.1.35, 2016\_09\_27) is one of those tools to provide data access to each \acrshort{tcga} disease through a \acrfull{rest} \acrfull{api}.
The 528 \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} patients' clinical information and \acrshort{rnaseq} data were obtained from the Firebrowse \acrshort{rest}ful \acrshort{api} with an R package, FirebrowseR (available at https://github.com/mariodeng/\linebreak
FirebrowseR)\cite{Deng2017}. 
We utilized FirebrowseR with our analysis workflow (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, \textcolor{green}{green} square) to receive standardized data frames while avoiding data re-formatting, often causing some errors.

\subsubsection{RNA Sequencing Data} 

The number of protein-coding genes was suggested as 20,500\cite{Clamp2007}. The \acrshort{gdc} Data Portal provided \acrshort{tcga} data has been harmonized and re-aligned \acrlong{rnaseq} data against an official reference genome build (\acrlong{grch38}, \acrshort{grch38}). \acrshort{rnaseq} expression level read counts produced by Illumina HiSeq have been normalized using the \acrfull{fpkm} method, as described in reference\cite{FPKM2017}.
The \acrshort{rnaseq} preprocessor of Broad \acrshort{gdac} picked the \acrfull{rsem} value from Illumina HiSeq/GA2 messenger \acrshort{rnaseq} level\_3 (v2) dataset of \acrshort{nci} \acrshort{gdc}. It made the messenger \acrshort{rnaseq} matrix with log2 transformed for the downstream analysis, as described in their reference\cite{RSEM2016}.
We utilized FirebrowseR's function call, Samples.mRNASeq(cohort = "HNSC", gene=GeneName, format="csv"), to download each \acrshort{rnaseq} data of all \acrshort{hnscc} patients and to save as 20,499 data frame files, named as "HNSCC.mRNA.Exp.[GeneName].Fire.Rda".
After careful investigation of the genomics dataset, the \acrshort{rnaseq} values of "\acrfull{slca}" and "\acrfull{slcb}" should be considered two distinct expression entities. We concluded that the number of protein-coding genes in the \acrshort{tcga} dataset is 20,500. We removed null expressed genes, which over 50\% of the cohort, to avoid the useless result.

\subsubsection{Clinical Data} 

We utilized FirebrowseR's function call, Samples.Clinical(cohort = "HNSC", format="csv"), to get all 81 clinical features (including pathological data, defined by \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{gdc} data dictionary: \acrfull{cde}\cite{CDE2019}) of all 528 \acrshort{hnscc} patients, which saved as one data frame file: "HNSCC.clinical.Fire.Rda" (accessed November 2019).
%\linebreak or \newline

One "HNSCC.clinical.Fire.Rda" tables and 20,500 "HNSCC.mRNA.Exp.[GeneName].\\
Fire.Rda" tables were transposed and merged by their \_participant\_barcode (unique patient \acrlong{id}, \acrshort{id}) to yield a data frame with 528 rows (participants) against 20,581 columns (81 clinical features as well as 20,500 protein-coding \acrshort{rnaseq} of cancer specimen).
The clinicopathological features selected for our workflow included gender, age, clinical tumor size, clinical cervical lymph node metastases, clinical distant metastasis assessment, pathological surgical margin, and tobacco exposure with their corresponding survival data.
The tumor size (T), cervical lymph node metastases (N), and distal metastasis status (M) were classified according to \acrfull{ajcc}\cite{Amin2017} along with \acrfull{uicc}\cite{Brierley2016} \acrshort{tnm} system for clinical staging of \acrshort{hnscc}.
% In the Eighth Edition, the AJCC has expanded the use of non-anatomic prognostic factors and biomarkers in assigning prognostic stage groups.
We made data clean by removing duplicated rows and columns.


\subsection{Cutoff Finder Core Engine}


%\label{key:cutoff}
To evaluate the effect of gene expression on the patient's survival, we introduce a sliding window cutoff selection by stratifying patients with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis according to each gene's low/high expression.
Our cutofFinder\_func subroutine employs the minimum \textit{P} value approach to recognizing cutoff points in continuous gene expression measurement for patients sub-population.
First, patients were ordered by \acrshort{rnaseq} value (RSEM) of a given gene. Next, patients were stratified at a serial cut (counted by person ranked in 30\% to 70\% percentile of the cohort; please see Figure \ref{fig:figure1} cutoff engine). The survival risk differences of the two groups were estimated by log-rank test to yield around 165 Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} values for each gene.
Then, the optimal cutoff of \acrshort{rnaseq}, giving the minimum \textit{P} value, was selected by the cutofFinder\_func subroutine.
This iteration method could calculate all possible cutoff of each gene expression in this cohort. At each run of cutofFinder\_func function call for an individual gene, it returned an optimal cutoff at specific patient grouping  (e.x. low-expression in 262 persons vs. high-expression in 152 persons with gene \acrlong{CAMK2N1}, \acrshort{CAMK2N1}, please see Figure \ref{fig:figure4}). The cutoff would be returned to the main program to allow downstream Cox survival analysis. The percentile range we applied as 30\% to 70\% was used to avoid a small grouping effect\cite{Miller1982}\cite{Mizuno2009a}.
In case there was no significant \textit{P} value, a median expression of this gene was set as its cutpoint as usual.
\begin{MyColorPar}{red}
The \acrfull{fdr} ($< 0.05$) correction has been applied to ensure the control of type I error of multiple test \textit{P} values during our cutoff finding procedure.
\end{MyColorPar}

\subsection{Statistical Consideration for Survival Analysis}

Our workflow has loops to call function survival\_marginSFP(GeneName) with given GeneName to process the survival analysis gene by gene.
We dichotomized the clinicopathological features, which includes gender (male/ female), age at diagnosed (below/beyond 65 year-old), clinical tumor size (T1-2/T3-4), clinical nodal status (negative/positive), clinical distant metastasis (negative/positive), TNM staging (early/late), surgical margin status (negative/positive) and tobacco exposure (low/high). The patients were grouped by an \acrshort{rnaseq} value of each gene, cut at low- or high-expression on an optimal \textit{P} value obtained from the cutofFinder\_func subroutine (see the section of "Cutoff Finder Core Engine"). Pearson's chi-square test was used for these binary variables. Kaplan-Meier survival was analyzed using the log-rank test for two groups OS comparison.

% reviewer comment 
\begin{MyColorPar}{red}
%The Cox proportional hazards regression is the widely accepted approach for modeling survival while 
The Cox proportional-hazards model\cite{Cox1972}\cite{Andersen1982} is commonly used for modeling survival analysis data. It allows to analyze survival with respect to one or more predictor variables and to provides the effect size (coefficients) for them\cite{Bradburn2003b}. % Classification trees and artificial neural networks in survival analysis
The Cox model is also accounting for confounding factors\cite{Magen2019}.
It is expressed by the hazard function denoted by h(t). Briefly, the hazard function can be interpreted as the risk of a specific event (e.x. death) at time t. It can be estimated as follow:

%Highlights
% https://quicklatex.com
\begin{flushleft}
% equation
%\begin{math}

$h(t) = h_0(t) \times exp(\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + ... + \beta_n X_n)$\\[0.3cm]
% natural exponential function => y=e^x
\end{flushleft}
where,\\
\begin{outline} % for highlight
\1 t represents the survival time
\1 $h(t)$ is the hazard function determined by a set of n covariates ($X_1...X_n$, e.g. clinicopathological features: such as age, gender, gene expression, cancer stage, smoking, alcohol, or even spiritual, emotional, and social status)
\1 the coefficients ($\beta_1...\beta_n$) measure the impact (i.e., the effect size) of covariates
\1 the term $h_0$ is called the baseline hazard. It corresponds to the value of the hazard if all the $X_i$ are equal to zero (the quantity exp(0) equals 1). The "t" in $h(t)$ indicates the hazard may vary over time
\end{outline}

Thus, the biomarker discovery strategy is survival modeling through collection of $X_1...X_n$ features from cancer datasets.\\[1cm]

Univariate Cox proportional regression model, using the "coxph" function in R package "survival", was applied to calculate hazard ratio, \acrfull{ci95} and its significance, and to estimate the independent contributions of each clinicopathological features and gene expression to the overall survival (OS) individually.

In a multivariate test, those covariates used include the clinicopathological features (gender, age at diagnosed separated by 65 year-old, clinical tumor size [T1-2/T3-4], clinical nodal status [N0/N+], clinical distant metastasis [M0/M1], TNM staging [stage 1-2/stage 3-4], surgical margin status [negative/positive] and tobacco exposure [low/high]), and gene expression level [low/high] defined by the cutoff.
All covariates has been pool in the hazard function h(t) to estimate their impact on the overall survival.

Results were considered statistically significant when a two-sided \textit{P} $<$ 0.05, or a lower threshold if indicated.
The \acrfull{fdr} ($< 0.05$) could be used to pick up the optimal \textit{P} value to ensure the control for type I error of the Kaplan-Meier survival test during the cutoff finding procedure.
%statistical inference problems in biomedical and genomic data analysis routinely involve the simultaneous test of thousands, or even millions, of null hypotheses. Examples
There were also multiple correlated tests of null hypotheses 
%in the Kaplan-Meier family 
during our global scanning of 205,00 protein-coding genes. The stringent Bonferroni correction could result in an adjusted \textit{P} value to ensure the control for type I error.

\section{Conclusions} % 5
% Conclusions: This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.
%The result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.
Our findings suggested 10 candidate biomarkers,CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, as well as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB, are all heavily associated with the prognosis of \acrshort{os} under optimal cutoff points with stringent Bonferroni \textit{P} values and proper confounders control. They also might be potential common biomarkers for subsequent study.
