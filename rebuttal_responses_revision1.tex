Dear Dr. Aubree Zhu:

Enclosed, please find our revised manuscript (cancers-1082127) entitled "A Global Genome-wide Scan with Optimal Cutoff Mining for Emerging Biomarkers in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma" by Chi et al., which we wish to be considered for publishing as a research article in Cancers. We greatly appreciate your time in serving as the editor handling this manuscript and also thank the reviewers for their critical comments and suggestions on our manuscript.

We have since performed additional analysis, experiment and revised the manuscript accordingly to address their critical comments and suggestions in a point-by-point manner, 
%{%
1) the description of the rationale that how to pick up the Thymosin Beta-4 X-Linked (TMSB4X) in details, 2) the statistical analysis of MALDI imaging mass spectrometry and 3) the IHC staining with positive and negative control images and further analysis of nuclear TMSB4X staining. 
We re-wrote the introduction in detail and re-examined the tissue microarray slides according to the suggestion by reviewer \#1.

According to the editor's comments, we have the manuscript checked for English grammar and reformat Table 1 by rotating 90 degrees to portrait mode. %（Table 1 轉正)

%{%
According to the reviewers' comments, we added new Figure 1C, 2, S2, S3, and Table S2. We also replaced Figure 3D and 4A with high magnitude images from the same slides. We transferred the original Figure 2 into supplementary Figure S1 to enhance the rationale and removed the old supplementary Table S1.

We greatly appreciate the reviewers for their helpful suggestions and critical comments on our manuscript. The detailed point-by-point reply to the reviewer’s comments are as follows (marked as \textcolor{blue}{blue}). 
And the revised portions in the manuscript are indicated in \textcolor{red}{red}.

%Reviewer #1(Technical Comments to the Author):
%   The ms investigates an interesting and timely topic. However, the discovery cohort involves a small sample size and throughout the analysis, the issue of correcting the obtained p-values for multiple comparisons is not addressed. Hence, the evidence for zooming into TMSB4X is not convincing.

Comments from the reviewer \#1:

Comments and Suggestions for Authors
The authors have described the effectiveness of RNA sequencing as a tool for exploring prognostic factors; they have also performed a large-scale analysis using the TCGA cohort, which is a very attractive analysis method. I have a few minor questions.

This is an attractive analysis method and I would like to know more details.

1-1) it is generally known that high expression of EGFR is a poor prognostic factor in head and neck cancers, however, why is it that RNA sequencing does not identify RNA coding for EGFR as a poor prognostic factor?

\begin{MyColorPar}{blue}
Answer

We appreciate the reviewer for the critical comments and thank for his/her agreement of our analysis using the TCGA cohort.
%[我的 candidate 中為什麼沒有 EGFR];  
In our analysis, the \acrshort{egfr} is ranked at 5707 from 20500 protein-coding genes %5708-1
by Kaplan-Meier estimate with the log-rank test P-value as 0.0495. The \acrshort{egfr} is identified as one of those poor prognostic factors as well. %However, it is far from the top 20 candidates.
(please see https://github.com/texchi2/pvalueTex/blob/master/HNSCC_OS_marginS_6429.csv for reference, the table was ranked by FDR P-value)

% transforming growth factor- (TGF-α) 
% epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
As in our manuscript mentioned, 
In a multivariate analysis, tumor site, tumor level of \acrshort{egfr}, and tumor level of TGF-$\alpha$ (\acrshort{egfr} ligand) were statistically significant predictors of disease-free survival of \acrshort{hnscc} patients\cite{Rusch1996}\cite{Grandis1998}.
Since that breakthrough discovery and validation, the \acrshort{egfr} monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) and \acrshort{egfr} \acrshort{tki} (such as gefitinib, erlotinib, osimertinib) were developed to treat advanced \acrshort{hnscc}. Although 90\% of \acrshort{hnscc} has overexpression of \acrshort{egfr}, cetuximab has only 10\% to 20\% response rate on those patients\cite{Johnson2020}. So far, cetuximab is still the only drug of choice with proven efficacy, which targeted the selected \acrshort{hnscc} patients\cite{Taberna2019}.
%citing the line number and exact change, marked in \textcolor{red}{Red from page 6 (line 16) to page 7 (line 17)}
Thus, we wish the further validations of our candidate genes to explore more useful drug of choice in the treatment of \acrshort{hnscc} patients.

 DNA alteration (mutation/amplification) is also an influential prognostic factor, but I would like to know if DNA alteration is considered in this analysis.
%[如果加入 DNA alteration 又會如何? 選擇 mRNA 的原因是?]

\begin{MyColorPar}{blue}
Answer

We appreciate the reviewer for the question.
a). mRNA study: in drug discovery, the gene expression (overexpression) is much easier to find a candidate for an inhibitory lead (pro-drug?) %比較容易研發

b). => it needs deep learning (DNA+RNA omics study)

The presence of widespread genomic instability in HNSCC, such as cytogenetic aberrations, allelic imbalance/loss of heterozygosity, and microsatellite instability, suggests that there is an imperfection in the host DNA repair machinery. Genomic instability with progressive accumulation of detrimental genetic alterations appears to be dependent upon a circuitous interaction between the environmental genotoxic insults and the host DNA repair machinery, the functional integrity of which is governed by the proper cell cycle control and host DNA repair capacity.

TMB: To calculate TMB, you need to know the total size of the region sequenced. If data is from exome sequencing, you would find the size of the exome capture, and divide total mutations (or non-synonymous only depending on strategy), by that size (e.g. ~45MB) to get SNV/MB ratio.

%雖然以上我們討論的是癌症的基因體，但癌症的厲害就是它本來就利用人體原有的生物機制來生存（co-opting），因此，以上在癌症觀察到的基因體複雜性，其實也存在於正常人體.

%從最早，很單純的基因之exon序列，轉錄成mRNA，再轉譯成polypeptide，形成protein，到現在還要考慮epigenetics、mi RNA、TUF (ENCODE將之名為transcripts of unknown function (TUF)=> non-coding RNA 後來很紅)、chromosome environment，基因體的複雜性真是增加了不知多少倍，這也提醒我們在了解基因功能方面，必需更有全面性的關照。這也是「基因體醫學」必需以「基因體科學」為基礎的道理。

%DNA mutation, copy number 增加造成 overexpression of gene

???Answer:
%所以 DNA vs mRNA
high dimensional multi-omics analysis by CNN 
%分析不是獨立變數，彼此有 confounding 放入分析需要使用不同的方法 

It may be beneficial to include these different data types in models predicting outcomes, such as the survival time of patients. Until recently, only data from a single omics type were used to build such prediction models, with or without the inclusion of standard clinical data [2]. In recent years, however, the increasing availability of different types of omics data measured for the same patients (called multi-omics data from now on) has led to their combined use for building outcome prediction models. An important characteristic of multi-omics data is the high-dimensionality of the datasets, which frequently have more than 10 000 or even 100 000 variables. This places particular demands on the methods used to build prediction models: they must be able to handle data where the number of variables by far exceeds the number of observations. Moreover, practitioners often prefer sparse and interpretable models containing only a few variables [3]. Last but not the least, multi-omics data are structured: the variables are partitioned into (nonoverlapping) groups. This structure may be taken into account when building prediction models.

NPB (Neuropeptide B) is endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptors, named GPR7\cite{Andreis2005}, which is associated with prostate cancer prognosis\cite{Cottrell2007}.

Highlights
\begin{itemize}
    \item The R script program could automatically scan protein-coding genes and generate the Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox's univariate/multivariate tables.
    \item Using a serial cut from 30\% to 70\% percentile of the cohort, it could find the least P-value cutoff of the Kaplan-Meier analysis for each gene expression.
    \item Our analysis could discover the pronounced biomarkers, which impact HNSCC's survival under the stringent Bonferroni adjustment.
\end{itemize}
